<h1>The Nanorex NanoEngineer-1 1.0.0 Application Suite</h1>
NanoEngineer-1 (NE1) is an open-source (GPL) 3D multi-scale modeling and simulation program for nano-composites with special support for structural DNA nanotechnology. It features an easy-to-use interactive 3D graphical user interface for designing and modeling large, atomically precise composite nanosystems.
<p>
In addition to NE1, this Suite includes:
<ul>
  <li> GROMACS+HDF5 - an extremely high performance, open source, and cross-platform package used to perform molecular dynamics simulation of systems with hundreds to millions of particles. NE1 currently uses GROMACS+HDF5 as an energy minimization engine option. <a href="http://www.nanoengineer-1.com/GROMACS+HDF5/">Learn more...</a>
  <li> QuteMolX - an interactive, high quality molecular visualization application aimed at improving clarity and understanding of the 3D shape and structure of large complex molecules. Users can "launch-and-load" QuteMolX directly from NE1. <a href="http://www.nanoengineer-1.com/QuteMolX/">Learn more...</a>
</ul>
This is the NanoEngineer-1 1.0.0 Application Suite as of April 25, 2008.
