Unit tests

Python supports unit testing with the PyUnit module. Information about
PyUnit is available at these websites:

http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/pyunit.html
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2004/12/02/tdd_pyunit.html
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/python/2005/02/03/tdd_pyunit2.html

To run the tests from the cad/src directory, do this:

(cd ../tests; PYTHONPATH=../src python chemtest.py)

[Note: the above syntax only works in some shells. Another shell command to
try is:

  (cd ../tests; env PYTHONPATH=../src python chemtest.py)
]

[WARNING: if this uses a different python executable than you normally run
on atom.py to start nE-1, you might need to remove *.pyc before and after
running these tests, to avoid any chance of incompatible .pyc files messing
up nE-1. This is not supposed to happen, but for certain Mac Pythons I have
had this problem. -- comment added by bruce 051005]

We should grow these tests as time permits. They are a quick handy way
to do some regression testing while developing. Also, these tests could
be helpful in keeping the modularization effort on track.
