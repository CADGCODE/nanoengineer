What are all these files? Four of them are used by DnaGenerator.py
to create DNA structures in the CAD program:

	adenine.mmp
	cytosine.mmp
	guanine.mmp
	thymine.mmp

-----

The other files are what I used to prepare these. I started with the
bdna.pdb file. I don't remember where I found it originally, but I
found another copy in these places, along with adna.pdb and zdna.pdb:

http://www.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Flick/molecules/
http://chemistry.gsu.edu/glactone/PDB/DNA_RNA/

My hope is that bdna.pdb is an authoritative representation for what
DNA should really look like. I proceeded with that assumption.

-----

The first thing I did was load bdna.pdb and separate the two strands.
That gave me strand1.mmp and strand2.mmp.

Then I hand-edited the drawing styles for the atoms in strand1.mmp to
create strund1.mmp. The base pairs alternate between wireframe drawing
mode ("lin" in the MMP file) and default drawing mode ("def" in the
MMP file).

The prepare.py script parses strund1.mmp to extract the four base
pairs as MMP files. It tries to get bond orders and hybridizations
right, and it rotates and translates them to a standardized
orientation. The output of prepare.py is those first four files.

While working on Z-DNA, I used a slightly modified version of
prepare.py. It needed modification because Z-DNA's structure does a
zigzag on each pair of bonds.
