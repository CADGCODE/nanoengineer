What are all these files? Four of them are used by DnaGenerator.py
to create DNA structures in the CAD program:

	adenine.mmp
	cytosine.mmp
	guanine.mmp
	thymine.mmp

-----

The other files are what I used to prepare these. I started with the
bdna.pdb file. I don't remember where I found it originally, but I
found another copy in these places, along with adna.pdb and zdna.pdb:

http://www.wellesley.edu/Chemistry/Flick/molecules/
http://chemistry.gsu.edu/glactone/PDB/DNA_RNA/

My hope is that bdna.pdb is an authoritative representation for what
DNA should really look like. I proceeded with that assumption.

-----

The first thing I did was load bdna.pdb and separate the two strands.
That gave me strand1.mmp and strand2.mmp.

Then I hand-edited the drawing styles for the atoms in strand1.mmp to
create strund1.mmp. The base pairs alternate between wireframe drawing
mode ("lin" in the MMP file) and default drawing mode ("def" in the
MMP file).

The prepare.py script parses strund1.mmp to extract the four base
pairs as MMP files. It tries to get bond orders and hybridizations
right, and it rotates and translates them to a standardized
orientation. The output of prepare.py is those first four files.

While working on Z-DNA, I used a slightly modified version of
prepare.py. It needed modification because Z-DNA's structure does a
zigzag on each pair of bonds.

Here are some old notes, pertaining mostly to zdna.pdb

The 5' and 3' terminators are respectively groups 32 (a single
hydrogen) and 359 (a hydroxyl). The groups representing base pairs are
as follows. The distances from the spinal carbon to the DNA axis
alternate for Z-DNA, so we'll need two copies of each base.

5' end (hydrogen)

9             guanine                   7.83
41            cytosine                  2.97

3' end (hydroxyl)

The 5' and 3' ends are reversed for strand B. When a strand1 guanine
is viewed from the +Z direction, its oxygen points clockwise, where a
strand2 guanine's oxygen points counter-clockwise. That's what we
want, it means the same bases will work for both strands with
appropriate rotations. You get the strand2 version of the base by
rotating it 180 degrees about a radial vector, so that its 5' and 3'
connectors are reversed. Where the strand1 sequence is CGCAAATTTCGC,
the strand2 sequence is GCGTTTAAAGCG.
