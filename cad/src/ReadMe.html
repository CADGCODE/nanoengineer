</ol>

<a name="GettingStarted"></a>
<h2>Getting Started with NE1</h2>
The best way to get started using NanoEngineer-1 is:
<ol>
  <li>Peruse this <a href="http://www.nanoengineer-1.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=Introduction_to_the_NanoEngineer-1_User_Interface">Introduction to the NanoEngineer-1 User Interface</a>.
  <li>Then work through some of the tutorials on our <a href="http://www.nanoengineer-1.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=Tutorials">Tutorials</a> wiki page.
</ol>

<a name="Extensions"></a>
<h2>Extensions for NE1</h2>
NE1 makes use of a number of free extensions and companion applications, including:
<ul>
  <li>GROMACS+HDF5, an extremely high performance, open source, and cross-platform package used to perform molecular dynamics simulation of systems with hundreds to millions of particles. The +HDF5 comes from our experimental HDF5 file format augmentation. NE1 uses GROMACS+HDF5 as an energy minimization engine.
  <li>Open Babel, used to import/export different chemistry file formats to/from NE1.
  <li>QuteMolX, a high-quality molecular visualization system that can be "launched and loaded" from NE1. Very cool!
  <!-- <li>NanoVision-1, an application for viewing molecular structures and simulations, especially those produced by NanoEngineer-1. -->
  <li>POV-Ray, which creates high-quality renderings of the current model with a single click of the mouse. 
  <li>MegaPOV (for Mac OS X), which creates high-quality renderings of the current model with a single click of the mouse. POV-Ray is also required. 
  <li>GNUPlot, used to plot the results of molecular dynamics simulations using NanoDynamics-1, NE1's own molecular dynamics engine for nanomechanical simulations. It is installed with NE1 for Windows and Mac. 
</ul>

<h2>New Features Archives</h2>
<b>What is new in NanoEngineer-1 1.0.0 (4/25/2008):</b>
<ol>
<li> Core User Interface Operations Support
  <ul>
  <li> A new DNA data model has been implemented that makes use of a unique DNA structure checking mechanism</a>.
  </ul>

<li> User Interface Improvements and Additions
  <ul>
    <li> DNA Strand Operations
    <ul>
	  <li> New handles for resizing segments and strands along the axis.
	  <li> Nick/break/join strands - now you can break a strand or join two strands via a break/join command on the toolbar.
	  <li> Create a crossover in one simple operation by selecting nucleobases from adjacent strands and invoking the context menu.
	</ul>
	<li> DNA Segment Operations
	  <ul>
	  <li> Change the length of segment
	    <ul>
	    <li> Constrained to central axis
		<li> By adding base pairs
        </ul>
	  <li> Rotate a segment about its central axis
      <li> Translate a segment along its central axis
	  </ul>
	<li> DNA Duplex Operations
	  <ul>
	  <li> Create a single DNA duplex by selecting two points on a plane
	    <ul>
		<li> The duplex is shown while you're selecting the second point and can be displayed in either ladder or ribbon display styles.
		<li> The duplex adheres to intelligent horizontal and vertical "snap-to-grid" rules allowing for rapid, horizontal and vertical placement.
		<li> Text next to the mouse cursor dynamically updates the number of base-pairs and the length of the duplex as you change the rubberband line during DNA duplex creation.
		</ul>
	  </ul>
	<li> Sequence Editor
	  <ul>
	  <li> Load sequences from a text file, paste them in, or even type them.
	  <li> Unique find/replace feature lets you quickly find and replace sub-sequences.
	  <li> Easily switch between 5'-3' and 3'-5' orientation.
	  <li> Save sequences to a separate text file.
	  </ul>
	<li> Peptide Generator
	  <ul>
	  <li> This experimental module can create atomistic models of polypeptide chains of arbitrary sequence and secondary structure.
      <li> The polypeptide chain can be built step-by-step by choosing consecutive amino acids from a set of the standard 20 naturally occurring amino acids.
	  <li> Local geometry of the built chain can be chosen from a set of predefined secondary structure geometries (alpha helix, 3-10-helix, pi-helix, or beta-strand) or explicitly defined by specifying a pair of phi/psi angles.
	  <li> A sequence of the peptide is visualized in a sequence viewer window and it is colored by current secondary structure type.
      <li> Note:
	    <ul>
		<li> Generated structures can't be minimized or simulated in a reliable way because the ND1 force field currently lacks certain atom types (e.g. amide-type nitrogen). The generated geometry is idealized, but after minimization it becomes wrong.
		<li> The structure is not visualized as it is being built, you need to press the "Preview" button to see it.
		<li> The structure can't be modified after it has been generated, nor can the sequence be edited.
		</ul>
      </ul>
    <li> Miscellaneous Improvements and Additions
	  <ul>
      <li> DNA generator now supports PAM3 and PAM5 models, but <b>not</b> atomistic models.
	  <li> A new rainbow-effect cylinder display style is now available for viewing reduced model PAM DNA structures.
	  <li> A new nanotube generator - create a single-walled carbon nanotube by selecting two points on a plane.
	  <li> Toolbar and dockwidget positions can now be saved between sessions.
      <li> Option to maintain the aspect ratio while resizing a plane. The ratio is updated automatically (i.e. anytime the plane's width and/or height are changed).
	  <li> The bond offset sphere checkbox in Extrude property manager is back.
      <li> Mirror feature enhancements - it can now mirror everything but the planes.
      <li> Triple-click any PAM atom to select all connected PAM atoms.
	  <li> New paste mode and related enhancements
        <ul>
        <li> New paste mode which can be accessed using menu Edit > Paste from clipboard... or corresponding button in the standard toolbar. You can return to the previous mode by hitting hitting the 'Done' or 'Escape' key.
        <li> Clipboard groups are now 'pastable' (so those are also included in the clipboard groupbox of Paste Mode)
        <li> Edit > Paste or Ctrl + V does a 'single-shot' paste operation. It pastes the most recently copied item. The item placement position is slightly modified compared to the original copied item.
        <li> Improvements to group pasting via paste mode. Now the groups are pasted at a closer place to where you double-clicked. 
        </ul>
      <li> New part library mode - the part library can be accessed in any mode by using Insert > Part from partlib... menu. You can return to the previous mode by hitting the 'Done' or 'escape' key.
      <li> When a single atom is selected, a new groupbox in the Build Atoms Property Manager, Selection Options, becomes active and shows the x, y, z coords of the selected atom. You can then use the spinboxes to move the atom precisely.
	  <li> NE1 can now be shown in full-screen mode (only menus and rulers appear around the work area) and semi-full-screen mode (includes all the toolbars as well.)
	  </ul>
  </ul>

<li> Structural DNA Nanotech (SDN) Part Library Additions
  <ul>
    <li> Several DNA double-crossovers such as DAE, DAO, DPE, DPON, DPOW, DX Tile, DX+J Tile, JX2, and PX65
	<li> Several SDN structures such as Mao's 3- and 6-point stars, Rothemund's star origami, Pierce's walker, Turberfield's tetrahedron, and Shih's octahedron.
  </ul>

<li> PAM5 and PAM3 Reduced DNA Models
  <ul>
    <li> The original PAM5 has undergone further refinements to improve the realism of minimized SDN structures
	<li> A new PAM3 model has been added for simplified creation, and clear, attractive display of SDN motifs
  </ul>

<li> QuteMol<sub>X</sub> Integration
  <ul>
    <li> QuteMol<sub>X</sub> is our branch of QuteMol. The branch allows us to continue to improve the code, and better integrate it with NE1.
    <li> QuteMol<sub>X</sub> now matches the display mode, background color, and atom coloring of NE1 when either launched from NE1, or when opening PDB files exported from NE1.
  </ul>

<li> GROMACS Integration
  <ul>
    <li> GROMACS has been added as an energy minimization engine. Structures can be minimized in the foreground, or in a separate background GROMACS process. The location of all the GROMACS input/output files, and the identifier (PID) for the GROMACS process is printed in the History text area at the bottom of NE1. An application called NanoVision-1, which is currently in development and not yet available, will be able to attach to, monitor, and cleanly abort the spawned GROMACS processes.
    <li> HDF5 support was added to GMX for writing and viewing trajectory files, but won't be fully realized until NanoVision-1 is available.
  </ul>
  
  <!--
<li> NanoVision-1
  <ul>
    <li> NanoVision-1 (NV1) is a cross-platform, open-source application that displays structures and simulations especially those produced by NE1 with GROMACS.
	<li> NV1 launches automatically when a backgrounded GROMACS minimization is initiated and shows a visualization of the minimization as it progresses.
  </ul>
  -->

<li> Notable Bug Fixes
  <ul>
    <li> The NE1 process now reliably ends upon exit of NE1.
    <li> POV-Ray scene fixed - bonds are now the correct color when a chunk is displayed in ball-and-stick style, and colored.
	<li> PAM reduced DNA models are now rendered properly in QuteMolX.
	<li> Fixed the "Rotate as a unit" checkbox in the Rotate groupbox.
	<li> Moiety copies are now placed closer together when extruding to a ring as final product.
	<li> Inserting a part with a hotspot from the parts library now works.
	<li> Newly read mmp files are no longer immediately marked as changed.
    <li> Added a mouse wheel governor for Mac users - using the mouse wheel to zoom is now manageable.
  </ul>

<b>What was new in NanoEngineer-1 v0.0.6 (8/17/2005):</b>
<ol>
<li> Atomic hybridization and higher order bond types:
  <ul>
  <li> Support for the following atomic hybrid orbitals:
     <ul>
     <li> Carbon: sp3, sp2, sp
     <li> Nitrogen: sp3, sp2, sp, graphitic
     <li> Oxygen: sp3, sp2
     <li> Sulfur: sp3, sp2
     <li> Hydrogen: s
	 </ul>
  <li> Support for the following bond types:
     <ul>
     <li> single
     <li> double
     <li> triple
     <li> aromatic
     <li> graphitic
     <li> carbomeric*
	 </ul>

* carbomeric bonds are an order-2.5 bond, sometimes used in carbomers. Alpha 6 
supports drawing and valence checking of carbomeric bonds, but they are 
simulated and stored in the mmp file as aromatic bonds.  This means carbomeric
bonds can't be stored and reloaded from a mmp file, which is a known bug we'll
fix for Alpha 7.

<li> Build Mode:
  <ul>
  <li> New Molecular Modeling Kit (MMKit) used for selecting elements and 
    atomic hybridizations
  <li> Bonds are selectable and can be deleted using CTRL+ Left-click (or 
    CMD + Left-click on MacOS X)
  <li> Bonds can be changed using new sub-modes on the dashboard
  <li> Clipboard integration with the MMKit for copying and pasting molecules
  <li> Keyboard accelerators for element and atomic hybridization selections
  </ul>
<li> Select Atoms Mode:
  <ul>
  <li> Support for copying/pasting selected atoms
  <li> Improved dashboard for selecting (and transmuting) atoms
  <li> Selection Filter now works for Select Connected and Select Doubly
  <li> Select Connected and Select Doubly have been added to the dashboard
  <li> Select Doubly much faster
  </ul>
<li> New GAMESS client interface:
  <ul>
  <li> Energy calculations
  <li> Optimizations
  <li> Supports PC GAMESS on Windows
  <li> Supports GAMESS-US on Linux/MacOSX
  </ul>
<li> Jigs:
  <ul>
  <li> Selection of Jigs in the 3D workspace (graphic area)
  <li> Copying and pasting of jigs (together with their chunk/atoms)
  <li> New model tree context menu item to select all atoms of any Jig or set 
    of Jigs
  <li> New model tree context menu item to disable/enable Jigs, which determines
    whether the Jig is used during a simulation
  <li> New model tree context menu item for Rotary/Linear Motors "Align to Chunk",
    which relaigns the motor
    to the first chunk it is attached to
  <li> New model tree context menu item for Rotary/Linear Motors "Recenter on 
    Atoms", which recenters the motor to the atoms it is attached to
  </ul>
<li> Molecular Dynamics Simulator:
  <ul>
  <li> Revised Simulator Setup dialog
  <li> Support for Linear motor
  <li> Jigs can be disabled (and enabled) in the model tree via their context menu
  <li> MD supported for atomic hybridizations and higher order bonds (see list 
    above) with the following exceptions:
	 <ul>
     <li> Still no torsion; this will make systems with double or 
       aromatic/graphitic bonds act less stiff than they really should.  
       The parameters for aromatic and graphitic bonds are interpolated rather
       than measured directly
     <li> The simulator does not handle hydrogen bonds or dative bonds
     <li> The parameters for stretches with fluorine and bends with boron or 
       a double bond to nitrogen are estimated rather than computed
     <li> The whole set may need an overall correction factor of some kind. The 
       main variable, absolute energy numbers from Gamess, is self canceling 
       since we're only using relative energies, and we used the same level 
       of theory for all the runs. Still there may be some systematic 
       correction that is needed
     <li> A more sophisticated fitting procedure, and support for electrostatics,
       is in the works for Alpha 7
	 </ul>
  </ul>

<li> New Preferences dialog (Edit > Preferences):
  <ul>
  <li> atom highlight color
  <li> free valence color
  <li> free valence hotspot color

  <li> turn on/off bond letters for double, triple, aromatic and graphitic bonds
  <li> background color (solid or gradient)

	 </ul>
  </ul>

  <li> Significant speed improvement
  <li> Circular arrow on end of rotary motor shaft rotates with motor
  <li> New "POV-Ray Series" save option that allows the user to dump the current
    movie as a series of .pov files (which can then be povrayed by the user
    and collected into an mpeg offline)
  </ul>
<li> Model Tree:
  <ul>
  <li> New model tree context menu item "Delete all clipboard items"
  <li> New model tree context menu item "Create new empty clipboard item"
  </ul>
<li> Opposite View:
  <ul>
  <li> New command (View > Opposite View) that flips the current view to the
    opposite side
  </ul>

<li> Align to Common Axis:
  <ul>
  <li> Now aligns selected chunks to the first selected chunk's axis (instead
    of the average axis of all selected chunks)
  </ul>
</ol>
