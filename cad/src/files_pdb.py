files_pdb.py -- reading and writing PDB files

@version: $Id$
@copyright: 2004-2008 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

History:

This was part of fileIO.py,
until bruce 050414 started splitting that
into separate modules for each file format.

bruce 070410 added some hacks to read more pdb files successfully --
but they need review by someone who knows whether they're correct or not.
(I'll commit this to both branches, Qt3 & Qt4, since this file is presently
identical in both, so doing that should not cause a problem.)

REMARK   6 - Sets of atoms are treated as PDB chains terminated with TER
REMARK   6   records. Since the number of atom sets can exceed the 95 possible
REMARK   6   unique chains expressed in ATOM records by single non-control ASCII
REMARK   6   characters, TER record serial numbers will be used to uniquely
REMARK   6   identify atom sets/chains. Chain identifiers in ATOM records will
REMARK   6   "roll-over" after every 95 chains.
