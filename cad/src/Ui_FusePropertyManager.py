History:
This file used to define UI specific to the Fuse PM. The legacy 
Fuse PM was converted to the new version that uses the PM module classes. 

Since the Ui code specific to Fuse PM was very short, it was accomodated in 
FusePropertyManager.py.  If, in future, new ui features are added to fuse PM, 
the whole UI code may be trasferred in this file. 
Ui_FusePropertyManager.py v 7800 and FusePropertyManager.py 7875 
show how this was done before.  -- Ninad 2007-08-21
