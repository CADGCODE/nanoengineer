version.py -- provide version information for NanoEngineer-1,
including author list, program name, release info, etc.

@author: Will, Mark
@version: $Id$
@copyright: 2005-2008 Nanorex, Inc.  See LICENSE file for details.

NOTE: this is copied and imported by autoBuild.py in a directory
which contains no other files, so it needs to be completely self-contained.
(I.e. it should not import anything else in its source directory,
only builtin Python modules.)

Module classification, and refactoring needed:

This should be given a less generic name, and also split into a
high-level module (since it would differ for different applications
built from the same code base) and low-level global access to the
"currently running app's name and version info"
(perhaps implemented similarly to EndUser)
for uses like printing version info into output files
(as in our caller in files_pdb).

In the meantime, to avoid package import cycles, we pretend this is
entirely low-level and classify it as either utilities or constants.
