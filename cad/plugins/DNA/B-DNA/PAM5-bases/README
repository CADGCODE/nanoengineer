These files are used by Dna.py to create PAM-5 DNA structures in the 
CAD program:

	EndBasePair.mmp
	MidBasePair.mmp
	StarBasePair.mmp

Each file contains two "Ss" pseudo atoms named "a" and "b" (via Atom info 
records) that get assigned their permanent base letter when the DNA structure
is generated. The "a" atom belongs to strand A and atom "b" is the complement
of "a" and belongs to strand B.
