The PyQt website says (regarding PyQt v. 3):

"PyQt is available under the GNU GPL and a commercial license, very similar to
the way in which Trolltech licenses Qt."

That's all it says. I can't actually find the license text on the website. I
presume that to get the actual license text, you need to contact Phil at
riverbankcomputing.co.uk.
