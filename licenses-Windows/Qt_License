We are using version 3 of Qt. When running on Windows, it has a
proprietary license. If you're a developer, you need to buy a license
from Trolltech to distribute your Qt-enabled software. If you're an
end-user, you don't need to worry about it.

At some time in the future, Nanorex will switch to Qt version 4, and
we will then distribute Qt with a GPL license on Windows.

See http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/licenses/licensing for more
information about how licensing works for Qt.
