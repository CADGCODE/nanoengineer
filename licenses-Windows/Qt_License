We are using version 3 of Qt, under a proprietary license for Windows
purchased from Trolltech. If you're a developer, you need to buy a license
from Trolltech to distribute your Qt-enabled software for Windows. If you're
an end-user, you don't need to worry about it, except for complying with the
Nanorex proprietary license under which you received this software.

See http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt/licenses/licensing for more
information about how licensing works for Qt.
