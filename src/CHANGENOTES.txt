Files: runSim.py, others
Summary: Support for Minimize Selection vs Minimize All, and improved their history messages.

(This commit doesn't yet fix progress bar caption or text to say which command is running,
and doesn't yet turn singlets into H for Minimize All like it does for Minimize Selection.
Further improvements to these are planned, but won't be listed separately in this file.)

Date: 4/13/2005

----------------------------

Name: Bruce Smith
Date: 4/13/2005
Files: GLPane.py
Summary: try to fix bug 530

This limits my bugfix from 4/8/05 (glpane or its edges would flicker to
black during main-window resize, which it turns out is a Mac-specific bug)
to the Mac, since that change also caused a new Windows-specific bug 530
(glpane flicker when covered by dialogs or menus, or maybe when they
disappear).
