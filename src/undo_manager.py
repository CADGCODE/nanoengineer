Own and manage an UndoArchive, feeding it info about user-command events
(such as when to make checkpoints and how to describe the diffs generated by user commands),
and package the undo/redo ops it offers into a reasonable UI.

    checkpoint calls from same, and undo/redo command callbacks.

# bugs in editClearUndoStack [some fixed, as indicated, as of 060304 1132pm PST]:
# cosmetic:
# + [worked around in this code, for now] '...' needed in menu text;
# + [fixed] need to disable it when undo/redo stack empty;
# - it ought to have ram estimate in menu text;
# - "don't show again" checkbox might be needed
# - does the dialog (or menu item if it doesn't have one) need a wiki help link?
# - dialog starts out too narrow
# - when Undo is disabled at the point where stack was cleared, maybe text should say it was cleared? "Undo stack cleared (%d.)" ???
# major:
# + [fixed] doesn't attempt to free RAM
# + [fixed] doesn't work: it doesn't update the Undo action (or, didn't clear the stack)...
#   hmm, it totally failed to work, it was even an "operation" on the undo stack itself, and so was the prior "deposit atom"
#   Theory about that bug: self.current_diff.suppress_storing_undo_redo_ops = True only matters if the varid_vers differed
#   across that diff, but they don't in this case since there was no real change and this is detected.
#   Possible fixes:
#   - make a fake change
#   - set another flag and behave differently
#   + [did this one, though it was harder than it initially seemed]
#     actually implement the freeing of all stored ops, which can't be that hard given that it's easy to tell which ones to free --
#     *all* of them! guess: stored_ops.clear(), in archive, in all calls of clear_undo_stack.
