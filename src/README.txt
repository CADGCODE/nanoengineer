INSTALLATION:

  2. To use nanoENGINEER-1's new Plot Tool, a copy of GNUplot 
     must be installed on your computer.  Only version 4.0 has
     been tested with nanoENGINEER-1, so it is recommended that
     this version be installed.

  Windows and MacOSX Installation:

     GNUplot 4.0 is included with the Win32 package installer.
     No extra software is required.

  Linux Installation (optional): 

     Simply download and install GNUplot 4.0 from:
     
     http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2055&package_id=1996&release_id=231440

  Note for Linux users: It is OK if you choose not to install
     GNUplot.  Without it, Plot Tool will not work, but everything else
     in nE-1 will work fine.
