== Installation Instructions ==

=== Linux ===

NE1 Alpha 9 must be compiled from sources for your Linux platform. Download the NE1 A9 tarball "NanoEngineer-1-09.src.tar.gz" and read the building from sources instructions for your platform at:

http://www.nanoengineer-1.net/mediawiki/index.php?title=Building_for_developers

=== Mac OS X ===

Run the NanoEngineer-1 self-extracting installer "NanoEngineer-1-0.9.dmg".

=== Windows ===

Run the NanoEngineer-1 self-extracting installer "NanoEngineer-1-0.9-w32.exe". 

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have a previous version of NanoEngineer-1 currently installed (e.g. Alpha 8) and attempt to install NE1 Alpha 9, the installer will prompt you with the following message:

"Set up will create the program shortcuts in the following start menu folder. To continue, click Next. If you would like to select a different folder, click browse" 

The default name it gives is "NanoEngineer-1 v0.8 (Alpha8)". This is a bug in the Windows installer.

TO FIX, TYPE IN "NanoEngineer-1 v0.9 (Alpha9)"

== Officially tested platforms ==

NE1 Alpha 9 has been tested on: 
* Windows XP Professional 2002, Service Pack 2
* Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger)

Limited testing has been done on Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther).

Limited testing has been done on Ubuntu 7.04 (Feisty). Ubuntu Linux is now the official Lunix platform for NE1 testing.

== Extensions for NE1 ==

NE1 supports a number of free 3rd party extensions (AKA plug-ins), including:

* GAMESS (for Linux or Mac) makes it possible to setup and launch ab initio and DFT computational chemistry simulations of molecular models inside of NE1.

* GNUPlot v4.0 is used to plot the results of molecular dynamics simulations using NanoDynamics-1, NE1's own molecular dynamics engine for nano-mechanical simulations. It is already included with NE1 for Windows and Mac.

* MegaPOV (Mac OS X only) creates high-quality renderings of the current model with a single click of the mouse. POV-Ray is also required.

* PC GAMESS (Windows only) makes it possible to setup and launch ab initio and DFT computational chemistry simulations of molecular models inside of NE1.

* POV-Ray is a free and very popular raytracing program that creates high-quality renderings of the current model with a single click of the mouse.

* QuteMol is a high-quality molecular visualization system that can be "launched and loaded" from NE1. Very cool!
