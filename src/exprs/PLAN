# $Id$

plan for the files in here:

will be cannibalized for useful parts:

testdraw1_cannib.py [copy is above]
testdraw2_cannib.py [copy is above]
NewInval.py
scratch5.py

will be removed someday, since copies of the above, but for now are used as ne1 glue into here:

../testdraw.py
../testdraw2.py

will survive upstairs as debug code, for awhile:

../testmode.py

junk:

scratch.py
scratch4.py
scratch_cubemath.py

will be maintained:

__init__.py
test.py

will be added:

a regression test file, or more than one

classes (names unclear): Env, RawExpr, UnderstoodExpr, Instance...

not sure if RawExpr, UnderstoodExpr are different; HelperClass seems to be both...

... and some .py files already added...
