===

plan for the files in this exprs directory:  [last updated circa 061011]

will be cannibalized for useful parts:

testdraw1_cannib.py [copy is above]
testdraw2_cannib.py [copy is above]
NewInval.py
scratch5.py

will be removed someday, since copies of the above, but for now are used as ne1 glue into here:

../testdraw.py
../testdraw2.py

will survive upstairs as debug code, for awhile:

../testmode.py

junk:

scratch.py
scratch4.py
scratch_cubemath.py

will be maintained:

__init__.py
test.py

will be added:

a regression test file, or more than one

classes (names unclear): Env, RawExpr, UnderstoodExpr, Instance...

not sure if RawExpr, UnderstoodExpr are different; HelperClass seems to be both...

... and some .py files already added...

list of the biggest language deficiencies or todos [as of 070105]:
- eval vs instantiate (semantic mess needs fixing)
- mappings in general
  - instantiation
  - glue code memoization
  - misc apps
- lexenv/dynenv disambiguation (and other widget_env cleanups)
- iteration constructs (generalized list extension, not just for lists but for categories/hypergraphs too)
- geometry needs to be geometric, not coordinate-based
- type coercion
  - polymorphic arg decls
- action/command syntax
- rule syntax
- layered data
- draw decorators (_e_decorate_draw), so highlighting and display lists can work properly together
- no compiling yet implemented
