cad/src/exprs/README

# $Id$

Note: this directory cad/src/exprs will someday become a python package in NE1,
but for now, it's still experimental, is never loaded by default, and perhaps not all its
source files have been committed.

For info on how to try it out, see file header of cad/src/testmode.py.

Its files mostly don't yet have proper file headers or copyright info. 
(They are all copyright Nanorex, Inc, same as the code in cad/src/*.py files.)

Regarding developer changes in cvs, all files in this package are entirely "owned" by Bruce
until further notice. 

See also PLAN and BUGS in this directory.
