I'm working primarily on a Mandrake 10.1 box. I hadn't installed
python-numeric-devel from the Mandrake DVD, so I was using headers and
libraries from Numeric 24.0b2 instead of Numeric 23.1 and that messed
me up for a while. There was a mismatch in the size of the struct for
a Numeric array.

Now that's all taken care of, and the Numeric array test works, and
the connectivity to OpenGL also works, at least on Linux.
