== Will's notes about the CoNTub Java code ==

The long-term goal is to translate the CoNTub code into C or Python,
and to do so in a way that's easy to use in our system. There are over
7000 lines of Java code, commented in Spanish, so this task may be
infeasible for a very near-term release.

A shorter-term goal (to be done entirely in Java) is to separate
CoNTub's graphical user interface from its computational logic, so
that we can put together a command-line executable that can be called
from nE-1. This should suffice for the next minor release.

With the completion of a command-line executable, it may become clear
that a much smaller amount of Java code may need to be translated into
C or Python. This would make the longer-term goal more feasible.

My preliminary effort will therefore be aimed at building a
command-line executable.

== Digging into details ==

There are three Java classes, P1, P15, and P2, which generate
structures, respectively the single-walled nanotube, the multi-walled
nanotube, and the heterojunction between two nanotubes. These classes
extend JPanel and are part of the user interface. There are two more
extensions of JPanel. We don't care about P3 because it's simply a
help screen. P35 is where output files are presented to the user.
Since applets don't have privileges to write files to the hard disk,
the user must cut-and-paste the information from a text field, in the
form of a PDB file.

For creating a single-walled nanotube, the immediately relevant
classes are therefore P1 and P35.

The structure of P1.java is this: GUI activity makes a call to the
actionPerformed method which determines the parameters i and j
(nanotube chirality) and l (nanotube length). A call is then made to
the generatubo method, which creates the list of atoms and bonds for a
nanotube of those specifications.

The data structure for a molecule is the MoleculaT class. (There is
also a MoleculaB class, and I don't yet fully understand the
distinction.) The MoleculaT class has a method (addVert) for adding
atoms, and three other salient methods. The cierraH and cierraN
methods terminate the ends of the nanotube with hydrogen and nitrogen
respectively. The ponconec method creates the bonds. There is also a
centrar method which centers a structure.

There appears to be a big opportunity for performance improvement in
the cierraH/cierraN and ponconec methods. This will be important for
large structures.

These appear to be the classes necessary for a standalone executable.
This list isn't final, but the final list should not be larger than
this: Atomo, Mensaje, Minimol, MoleculaB, MoleculaT, Nanotubo, anillo,
formato, pto2D, pto3D, tabPe, plus any new classes we write to subsume
functionality from P1, P15, P2, and P35.

== The W1 class does single-walled nanotubes ==

The W1 class is a command-line version of the P1 class. It accepts
parameters for chirality, length, and termination, and creates a
single-walled nanotube. It produces an MMP file which goes to standard
output, so it would typically be called like this.

 java W1 40 0 60 1 > ~/nt.mmp

The structure specified here contains 2240 atoms and takes about 0.4
seconds to generate.

"java W1" is how we tell the Java virtual machine to run the main()
method in the W1 class. The four parameters are:
* first chirality parameter
* second chirality parameter
* length of the tube in angstroms
* element number for termination
** 1 for hydrogen termination
** 7 for nitrogen termination
** anything else for dangling bonds, no termination

== The W2 class does nanotube heterojunctions ==

The W1 class is a command-line version of the P1 class. It accepts
parameters for chirality, length, and termination, and creates a
single-walled nanotube. It produces an MMP file which goes to standard
output, so it would typically be called like this.

 java W2 20 0 20 30 0 20 1 > ~/nt.mmp

The structure specified here contains 1450 atoms and takes about 0.7
seconds to generate.

"java W2" is how we tell the Java virtual machine to run the main()
method in the W2 class. The four parameters are:
* first chirality parameter, first tube
* second chirality parameter, first tube
* length of the tube in angstroms, first tube
* first chirality parameter, second tube
* second chirality parameter, second tube
* length of the tube in angstroms, second tube
* element number for termination
** 1 for hydrogen termination
** 7 for nitrogen termination
** anything else for dangling bonds, no termination
