The idea is to create Pyrex base classes for atoms, bonds, and atom
sets that make some operations much more efficient, primarily graphics
operations and undo/redo operations. An additional benefit is that we
can start to define atoms, bonds and atom sets in a way that isn't
dependent upon Qt or OpenGL or other GUI-related stuff, so that
somebody can import them into a Python script without having all the
GUI stuff installed. This should not conflict with formulating them in
a way that makes graphics operations efficient. With a little luck we
will find that they are efficient with different kinds of graphics
systems (e.g. Gtk, WxWindows).
