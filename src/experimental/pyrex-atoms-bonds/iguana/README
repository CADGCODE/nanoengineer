DOCUMENTATION

Note to self: it would be good if documentation could have some simple
annotations to make it "structured", so that I could automatically
crank out Docbook or HTML or whatever. Try to extend this to the
docstrings, and think about how to connect the docstrings to this
README.

For now, the best documentation is the unit test.







IMPROVEMENTS

When compiling a program, the list of integers should be copied to a C
int array as a one-time activity. That would make it a lot faster.

Replace "exit" with ";"? I dunno.

Make each iguana verb a Python object, and give each one a doc string.

One way to write a program would be to write a Python list of verbs;
it wouldn't only be strings. This could allow for programmatically
constructed iguana programs.
