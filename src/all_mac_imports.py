# These are the modules for which the import problem has ever been observed
# (on a mac subject to bug 1724). For some of them, the problem was observed in some tests
# but not in others. To test which specific module first hits the import problem
# (on a mac subject to the bug), touch the file ~/DEBUG-1724 and read the Console.app output.

import multiarray # this had the problem before, but doesn't have it on 060407

import OpenGL.GLU # this has the problem on 060407 via  GL__init___
import OpenGL.GLUT # we shouldn't be using glut anymore, is this still needed here? 2007/03/01 -emm

# These modules are seemed similar enough to the above to need to be test-imported every time:
import OpenGL.GLE

# These modules are deemed suspicious enough to test-import every time, even though we have no 
# specific reason to worry about them:

import sip
import Numeric

# The remaining modules are unlikely to have problems, and it takes too long to always
# test-import them all. (#e Maybe we should do it if debug_1724 is set? Maybe we should create
# that file during the startup's dangerous phase, remove it later, so that it's left in place
# if the error happens, so that user can repeat the test and get better debug info?)

    # for speed; the above might be enough to test, and this saved 4-5 seconds
    # back when only 'multiarray' was imported above [bruce 060327]
    # (it would be good to figure out which of the other ones are slow)
