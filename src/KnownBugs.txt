NanoEngineer-1 v0.8 (Alpha 8). Release Date: July 13, 2006 (For Mac and Linux)

This file documents some bug fixes, unsupported features and some of the commonly encountered bugs in NanoEngineer-1 Alpha8. 

Some of the Bug Fixes In Alpha 8

1. Simulator/Minimize: The simulator doesn't take into account the effect of torsion. This will make systems with double or aromatic/graphitic bonds act less stiff than they really would. (Although torsion and out of plane terms are included, please note that this still has some known bugs. For example, minimize returning high values for some structures or taking long time to finish)
2. Bond type changing tools in Build mode don’t work on bondpoints (833-1)
3. Povray rendering doesn't show different bond types (it will be supported feature for this version) (830)  
4. Can not copy named view to the clipboard (1369)
5. Movie playing gets slower because of the progress bar (1898)
6. Can not 'Move Absolute' the selection to (x,y,z) if a motor is present (1990)

UNSUPPORTED FEATURES:

#UNDO/REDO 
- Undo/Redo knows nothing about the mode the program was in. For example, if you extrude a moiety while in extrude, return to your default mode and then hit Undo, it will only separate the base and repeat units. It will not go back to extrude mode. (1391)
- MMKit tab and button changes and most changes made in the dashboards are not recorded in the Undo stack 
- On large models, undo and other operation might become slower. Further performance improvements will be implemented in a future release of the software

#PDBs With Multiple Bond Information Not Supported 
 This version of NE1 treats all bond types as single bonds while reading from or writing to a PDB file. Also, it doesn't save the hybridization type into the PDB file. For example, (sp2) hybridized Carbon in a structure will be saved as a sp3 hybridized Carbon with wrong bond valence. (3 bonds instead of 4). Also, the double bond of this (sp2) Carbon is saved as a single bond Therefore, save your models ONLY in MMP file format to avoid major loss of work (569, 763)

SIMULATOR / MINIMIZE
# Simulator/Minimize: will support bonding between elements specified in the element selector of NanoEngineer-1. 
# Simulator/Minimize: Multiple bonding between certain elements is generally supported, but some parameters are estimated. The history message during a simulation run notifies user if it is using an estimated/reduced quality parameter. 
# Simulator: Electrostatic interactions are not supported; in particular, the hydrogen and dative bonds are not handled. 
# Enable motor in minimize feature is experimental. Enabling a motor in minimization may result in high values of rms force. Also, minimize will take long time to finish.
# Various DNA structures can be modeled in NanoEngineer-1 but minimization/simulations of the generated structures is not supported. 

GAMESS Jig
#GAMESS jig can be added by select some atoms first in 'Select Atoms' mode and then attaching this jig by using Menu item: Jigs>Gamess. This jig can be attached to a maximum of 200 atoms. 
-- Certain GAMESS optimization runs or Energy calculation can take very long time (hours/days). While a GAMESS job is being performed, user is not allowed to do any other operation in that session of NE1. User must wait till the GAMESS job is finished or opt to terminate it by hitting 'Cancel' button in the progress bar. 
-- Also, certain GAMESS run may create large output files. So make sure that your system has enough disk space to handle such runs. ALL GAMESS jobs are save inside the 'Job Manager' directory. (User's home directory/ Nanorex/Job Manager) (742)
 
ESP IMAGE / NANO-HIVE
# ESP Image jig is not fully supported on Linux and MAC platforms. On Windows, you can perform ESP calculations for some standard cases provided that a correct version of NanoHive is installed. In general ESP image is partially supported and has many known bugs. These issues will be fixed in an upcoming release of NanoEngineer-1.

# Bond Inference not supported but a limited valence error check supported. 

By the term 'bond inference' we mean automatically deciding what type of bond will be formed between the participating elements. It is not supported for this version of NE1. When an element is deposited, by default, all the bonds are single bonds. User must manually change the bond type between the elements in 'Build mode'. However, if the structure is not chemically correct (bad valences etc), NE1 shows a 'pink wire frame' around each atom indicating valence errors.  This 'valence error' display, by default, is enabled. It can be changed from the 'Bonds' tab in the Preferences dialog. (Edit>Preference…).  
Note that there are some kinds of chemical errors this (the Valence Error Checker) doesn't detect. For example, it can't tell whether rings should be aromatic or not. All it checks is that the bonds on each atom could possibly add up to the right number of valence electrons. The Valence Error Checker doesn't treat graphitic and aromatic bonds differently.
      

MISCELLANEOUS
 
# Unicode characters are not supported for naming the items in the model tree. (474)
# NanoEngineer-1 Alpha7 is tested and supported only on Windows XP, MAC OS X 10.3.X, 10.4 and Mandrake Linux 10.0, 10.1. It is not supported on Intel based MACs (e.g. Macbook pro).  There are some known issues on other operating systems such as Fedora Core 4, Gentoo Linux (e.g. the program hangs or some display issues etc).  (1049, 1058, 1201, 1724)
 
 
KNOWN BUGS (ALL PLATFORMS)

MEMORY AND PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS
# Memory consumed by the application increases due to repeated execution of certain operations such as opening and closing a file (often termed as ‘memory leaks’. This affects the overall performance of the software and could result in a crash. This version doesn’t prevent such memory leaks. 

# NE1 has some known performance problems while using some features. As a result, some operations take considerably longer times. This is particularly true when you are handling a large file. 
Examples: Opening a large file, Operations performed in Fuse mode, moving selected atoms, Selecting and deselecting some atoms from a large chunk, deleting some atoms, Undoing or redoing these operations, playing a movie on a large model etc. may take longer time when the file size is large. (991, 1473, 1674, 1704, 1750, 1778)

#Movie playing is lot slower for large models on some low system configuration machines. Also, other normal operations such as opening a file become slower for such machines (1757)

 
ESP IMAGE JIG (NANO-HIVE)

ESP image has many known bugs or unimplemented features. Some Examples: 
- ESP calculations on some structures is not done and a black ESP image is created
- Program switches to Build mode while inserting an ESP jig 
- Some bugs in the ESP dialog box options and implementation

MINIMIZE/SIMULATOR
(see also: the Unsupported Features section)

# For some structures it needs multiple executions of 'minimize' to boil down the high force to a lower value. Sometimes, even after repeated minimize operations, it gives high rms and high force values(1892) 
# Quite often, the rms & high force inconsistently increase during each execution of 'minimize'. Thus minimizing a structure could result in a new structure with a higher RMS force value than the input structure.  It should be the case that the new structure will always have a lower potential energy than the input structure, even if the RMS force value may sometimes be higher. This will be fixed in a future release of the product. (1377)
# Simulator: In some cases, hydrogen atoms or other elements 'fly away' while running a simulation movie. This happens when atom centers are very close and therefore the repulsive force becomes very high (528, 558) 
# Rotary motor doesn't rotate if a thermostat is attached to the chunk. Workaround is not to attach a thermostat jig when a rotary motor is present (1889)
# Linear motor doesn't move the atoms if a thermostat jig is attached (1893)
# Linear Motor: Even when there are two parts far enough apart that they shouldn't interact too much, the presence or absence of one part strongly affects the linear motor behavior. In such cases, the linear motor doesn’t move the attached atoms (1895)
# Enable motor in minimize feature is experimental and has some bugs. Examples- the final rms and high force values after minimize are large, it takes long time to finish minimize operation. (1835, 1836)
# For some structures with multiple bonds, minimize takes very long time. This is true even for the smaller structures. (1957)
#During a simulation run, temperature of some structures especially with aromatic or graphitic bonds increases. This is undesirable and will be fixed in an upcoming release (2029)
# Minimize doesn’t always honor the specified value of EndRMS in the Energy Dialog. For example, if EndRMS value is specified as 1pN, for some structures, minimize may terminate early and return a final RMS value greater than 1pN (2038)

SELECTION 

# Selection: Can not select a chunk by clicking on any of the bonds in that chunk. (11) 

#Selection wireframes won't be displayed or will act weirdly on some platforms. This could be due to the old version graphics driver on your machine. Example: Some Windows XP users with Intel Integrated 855 graphics reported this problem which went away after installing an updated version of that driver (Intel 855 chipset driver 6.14.10.4497.). It is highly recommended that you use up-to-date drivers to avoid this issue (1720)

# Contract Selection doesn't work correctly in some cases. Also the What's this text doesn't clearly explain this feature. (1358)

# It is tough to select chunks with Cylinder display (2004)

 
BUILD MODE
# Highlighting in Build mode is problematic in some cases. Examples: 1) When more than one NanoEngineer-1 applications are running. 2) If vertical splitter of the Model Tree is dragged to adjust Model Tree's width 3) If Main NE1 window is maximized etc. (1241, 1243, 1637)

# Zoom/Pan/Rotate Tools in Build mode: If you click on Zoom, Pan or Rotate tools while in Build, the MMKit and other Build features will become temporarily unavailable while you use these tools. (1518)
# Build: In lines display , the atom center doesn't get highlighted (if the atom is not selected). Thus, you can not perform operations such as change hybridization , move the atom while in lines mode  Simple workaround is to change the display representation to Tubes or CPK or Ball&Stick.(1837)  
# Build/ Bond Order : The context menu 'Reposition Bondpoints' of an atom reorients the bondpoints but while doing so, it makes the bondpoint type as single.  Let's assume that a Carbon atom with (sp2) hybridization is deposited in build mode. Now you highlight one of its bondpoints, right click and select 'double bond' from the context menu. The representation of the bondpoint will change to a 'double bondpoint'. Now, if you highlight the atom center, right click and select 'reposition bondpoints', it will clear the 'double bondpoint' representation you just made and thus, all three bondpoints of (sp2) carbon will be represented as single bond type. (839) 
 
MOLECULAR MODELING KIT IN BUILD MODE
 
This feature has some known bugs. Also refer to Linux Only Bugs and 'Dialogs and Dashboards' bug sections for some related issues. 
 
# MMKit: Sometimes this dialog box doesn't close even after main window of NE1 is closed. It goes away after a few seconds though. (852)  
# If an MMP file in the MMKit’s library has jigs those won’t be pasted along with the part. Also, group records won’t be available when you paste a part from the library (1164, 1080)
# MMKit: MMKit’s 3-D thumbnail view doesn’t get updated in some cases.(1848)
# Library tab: If the library tab is showing a large model in the thumbnail view , you switch to some other tab and then return to the library tab, it might take long time to open that tab. (939)
#  Modeling Kit: For lower resolution screens the Modeling kit occupies most of the Model Tree space, thus obscures most of the Model Tree area.(1437)  
# Modeling Kit: If the 'Clipboard' tab of Build mode's Modeling Kit dialog is open and then you hit a keyboard modifier key (e.g. C, 'S', '1' etc), the program is supposed to switch back to 'Atoms' tab. But in some cases, it doesn't because of a keyfocus issue. In order to overcome this bug, try clicking inside 3D workspace once, then hit a modifier key. Now it should change to 'Atoms' tab. 

MOVE MODE
 
# Move: Keyboard modifier keys that constrain translation or rotation around an axis (e.g. press 'Y' and 'R' to rotate the selected chunk around Y axis.), doesn't work for the first time after you perform 'delta +' or 'delta ,' operations (which move a chunk by a specific distance). A workaround is to press and release the modifier keys and then press them again to perform these operations. (674)  
 
EXTRUDE MODE
 
#  The 'extrude a ring' feature has some bugs. These will be fixed for the Beta release of NanoEngineer-1. To use extrude's 'Ring Mode' effectively, make sure you follow these steps:  
-- Get everything adjusted first in the 'rod mode'.  For example, select the proper bond offset sphere or arrange the copy units such that you can see their bondpoints highlighted in a way you would like to bond them. (In general, while in the ring mode, adjustments made from graphics area don't work)
-- Then, you may switch to "Ring Mode" by selecting ring from the rod pull-down menu on the dashboard. While viewing the ring, you may increase the number of copies. 
-- If you need to do any further adjustments, switch back to "Rod Mode", make changes and switch back to the "Ring Mode".  
-- Select the 'Done' button on the dashboard when finished. (155)
 
# Extrude: Separates the chunk permanently when atoms are partially selected and then extrude mode is cancelled. (198) 
# Extrude: Multiple chunks are automatically merged into a single chuck, even when cancel is hit. (397)  
# Extrude's ring feature doesn't take the curvature into account while forming the bonds. (494) 

COOKIE CUTTER

# Cookie Cutter: Large selections can cause response latency. (8)  
# Cookie Cutter: Right click while rotating the grid using middle mouse drag operation, changes the grid orientation (59)  
# Cookie Cutter/Display bug: the 3D workspace (graphics area) turns into a black display if you resize the NE1 window while drawing an auto shape e.g. a circle or a hexagon etc. The original display can be regained by hitting any key. (687) 
 
FUSE CHUNKS MODE

# Fuse Chunks: operations while in this mode are sluggish if it's a large model. However, its performance is improved compared to Alpha6 (689) 
# Fuse Chunks: If the chunks were 'merged' in previous operation while bonding them together, 'Back Up' button on the dashboard doesn't 'unmerge' them. It only deletes the bond formed in earlier operation. (486-10)  
# Fuse Chunks: Back up button on dashboard to delete a bond formed in previous operation deletes the bond, but it doesn't restore the previous bond angles. (502-16)  
# Fuse Chunks can not bond elements of two or more chunks if they are already bonded. Also, some history messages are not correct.  (580)  
 
MOVIE PLAYER

# Movie playing is lot slower for large models on some low system configuration machines (1757)
# Extrude Tool/Movie: Simulation movie becomes invalid if it is created while in extrude mode, after adjusting the chunks (to be extruded) as 'bondable' with their copy units. (495)  
# Movie/Clipboard: While playing a simulation movie, if you click on a different clipboard item (rather a clipboard 'Part'), then the movie can not be 'viewed'. But it continues to run. NE1 doesn't print a warning message to instruct user to click on the appropriate 'Part', for which the movie is created for,  to view the movie. (578-5) 
#  Movie: If you run a simulation and then modify the model further (e.g. delete some atoms etc), the movie becomes invalid.  NE1 generally identifies such situations. But in certain cases, it doesn't.  Some Examples: After creating a simulation movie, if you 'Hydrogenate' some chunks or change the bond types or 'transmute' some elements to a different one. To avoid this, always rerun a simulation after doing such modifications for the correct results. (901)
 
NAMING
 
# Naming of created items: When starting a new part or opening a new file, the object name indexing is not reset to 1. For example, new chunk names continue to increment from the previous part's index number. (64) 
# Naming GAMESS Jigs: If a Gamess jig contains a Forward or Backward Slash in it (e.g. 'AM1/None'), then the Gamess job will fail. So do not include these characters while naming this jig. (796)  
# Model Tree: Dragging and dropping objects onto the part icon at the top of the list places the items(s) at the bottom of the list. Similarly, dragging and dropping items onto a group folder places them at the bottom of the group, not the top.  (360) 
 
CURSOR AND DISPLAY RELATED BUGS
 
# Cursors: Middle mouse button "Hint Cursors" can sometimes get stuck. Usually, if you press and release the Shift or Ctrl/Cmd key, the appropriate cursor is restored.(113, 158,404)  
# Display: The front clipping plane will sometimes clip objects that should not be clipped  
# Display: Valence error wire frame is displayed even for invisible atoms. Also, while Build mode when you move cursor inside such a wire frame, even the invisible atom center gets highlighted. (870) 

DIALOGS AND DASHBOARD
 
# Users operating NE1 with a low screen resolution and large font size report bugs in the dialog boxes and dashboards. In such cases, the dashboard items of some modes are not visible, tolerance slider bars don't operate correctly, some property forms such as Modeling Kit occupy most of the space in model tree etc. (513, 581, 844)  
# There are some bugs in the Nanotube, DNA, Heterojunction and Graphene dialogs. For example dialog doesn’t go away after doing certain operations involving ‘preview’, file getting modified even after cancelling the dialog, bugs in history messages etc. (2045, 2054, 2057)
 
POVRAY RENDERING
  
# Povray rendering of lines display is shown as black lines (226)
# Motor arrows are not rendered (527)  
# If a motor is attached to only a single atom, povray image can not be rendered (719)
# Povray image rendered incorrectly in some orientations of the linear motor (1755)
# Measurement jigs, ESP Image Volume(outline) and Grid lines in a grid plane jig are not rendered in the generated povray file.  (1084, 1196, 1198)
# Chunks with Cylinder display are not rendered. (2003)

MISCELLANEOUS
 
# User can not save exclusive features of NanoEngineer-1 into the PDB file format. Some examples of such 'MMP file only' features include jigs, groups, hidden states of chunks, multiple chunks, entire clipboard feature etc.  NE1 doesn't give enough warning messages for users trying to save such features into a PDB file. (252)  
# Only open one main window. Opening more than one NanoEngineer-1 application window will have unexpected results. (362)  
# Any file currently opened by NanoEngineer-1 can be manually deleted from the computer without any warning message. (215) 
# View > NormalTo doesn’t work when multiple chunks are selected. (1748)
# Insert > Heterojunction and Insert > DNA has some known bugs. 
 
WINDOWS ONLY BUGS
 
# On some machines, the program crashes after while running repeated simulations in some special cases. (1753) 

# During drag-and-drop, node icons are not shown in the cursor's drag object. (360) 
# On very rear occasions, the File>Open, Save, Save dialogs don't pop up because of some python.exe application problems. It might happen if you are working with a huge file with lots of GAMESS jigs in it. Again, it is very unlikely to happen. Saving your work often while working on large file is recommended. (774) 
 
MACINTOSH ONLY BUGS

# Sometimes a cursor's bitmask will suddenly not work, leaving a white square around the cursor. (772)
# On iMac the 'material specular highlighting' doesn't show up (1866). 
# Icon toolbar redrawing of the icon images will show up overlapped, zig-zagged, cracked, etc. in certain situations. In worst cases, the right-side icon bars will go invisible until the invisible bar is clicked on, which redraws the bar but changes your button. This usually only happens when resizing the main window by dragging its "resize handle" on the lower right of the window frame. The workaround is to resize it to be a bit smaller than you want, and then make it a bit bigger again so that it's the desired size. Some users report that the toolbars always draw wrongly after that initial down-sizing, but then they always draw properly again after that final small up-sizing. (861) 
# Occasionally, bouncing between programs will lead to the menu (screen top) disappearing, only to re-appear with mouseover (or mouseover+click).  
# On Mac OS X Tiger, the tool buttons don't look 'pressed'. On other platforms this is not a problem. NE1 provides a workaround for this. In the 3D Workspace (i.e. Graphics area), press Shift and Option keys and do Command click to bring up the debug menu. Now select the "Mac OS 10.4 QToolbutton Workaround" command from this debug menu. This will resolve the issue. (878) 
# On some MACs , some cursors and icons in MMKit and dashboard are not displayed (1824, 1838)
# Image with a bmp extension is not rendered in Povray Scene feature (although a .bmp file is created in the PovRay Files directory of that model. (2110)
 
LINUX ONLY BUGS

# System crashes while accessing wiki help via the URL provided in What's this text of that mode. Workaround is to use the Mode specific Wiki Help dialog that pops up when you hit F1 key (1447)
# NanoEngineer-1 sometimes crashes while operating on a bigger file and extensively using features such as clipboard, copy, extrude, select, undo etc. (1885)
# Minimize progress messages in the status bar is truncated for lower resolution and larger font size (1794)  
# Status bar text on bottom right corner can get obscured during minimize or simulation and thus affects the display of (for example) the minimize progress.  (1282)
#Opening a plot file from the plot tool dialogs needs 'kwrite' editor which is available with only with KDE desktop (434)  
# Modeling Kit in Build Mode: When you enter build mode, this dialog first appears in the middle of the 3D workspace (graphics area) for a fraction of second and then it is moved to the left hand side of the NE1 main window. The amount of time this dialog stays inside the 3D workspace depends on the model size. (844) 
# When you start the program in a consol window, some warning messages will be printed. E.g. Warning: import bsddb failed; using some other db format for preferences file giving it a different name in case that uses an incompatible binary format; this means, when you upgrade to bsddb, you'll lose your preferences. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a future release. (1896)
