nanoENGINEER-1™ v0.0.5 (Alpha 5)


Bug Fixes In Alpha 5

* Bug #281 Cookie Mode: When adding a new layer, there is no visual clue indicating a new layer has started. (Now, cookie is drawn  with a different color for each layer) 

* Bug #313 Cookie mode sends the objects (origin) deeper into the screen (graphics area) after exit from that mode. 

* Bug #371 Display bug associated with a cut operation on a chunk (which is bonded with another chunk). It stretches the inter-chunk bond and keeps bonded portion of cut chunk visible

* Bug #395 Movie player directly jumps to the last frame if, you play a movie, then create a new movie with lesser number of frames than the original one and then enter the movie player in order to play the new movie.

* Bug #422 Minimize: Large values written to the MMP (or to the generated XYZ) file after minimizing a model containing overlapped open bonds or excessively stretched bonds 

* Bug # 433 Errors/bugs when a blank PDB file is inserted into any open file using File->Insert.

* Bug #489  The parameters in the simulator always reset to default rather than parameters that were set last

* Bug #507  The time when ‘lighting dialog box’ pops up, the lighting settings of the model get modified automatically if the model is not under home view.


Unsupported Features:

1. Undo/Redo not implemented. 

2. Points, lines, and planes are not implemented yet. (47) 

3. Simulator will support bonding between elements specified in the element selector of nanoENGINEER-1. Multiple bonding is not supported for alpha. 

4. nanoENGINEER-1 (nE-1) treats all bond types as single bonds while reading a PDB file and also while writing a PDB or MMP file. Therefore, if you open such a PDB file, do not save it using current nE-1 version (569)

5. The 'Clipboard' has limitations and some bugs. 

6. The symmetry information for a selected chunk cannot be obtained. (261)

7. sp and sp2 bonds are not supported.

8. Aromatic bonds are not supported.

9. Bonds are not selectable.

10. Linear motors are not supported by the simulator. (393) 

11. Unicode characters are not supported for naming the items. Also, to avoid some bugs do not use a closing parenthesis symbol ‘)’ while naming the items in nE-1. (474)


Known Bugs (All Platforms)

1. Delete operation cannot be undone. In fact, Undo/Redo are not implemented yet. SAVE YOUR WORK OFTEN!

2. If you select the part icon (top icon in the model tree) and hit the delete key (or click Delete), the entire part will be deleted without asking the user for confirmation. (147) 

3. Any file currently opened by nanoENGINEER-1 can be manually deleted from the computer without any warning message. (215)

4. Only open one main window. Opening more than one nanoENGINEER-1 application window will have unexpected results. (362)

5. User can not save exclusive features of nanoENGINEER-1 into the PDB file format. nanoENGINEER-1 doesn't give any warning message for users trying to save such features in a PDB file. (252)

6. The MMP File Format specification included in the nanoENGINEER-1 Assistant is obsolete. The most current version can be found at “ www.nanoengineer-1.com/mambo/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=23&Itemid=37  “

7. Simulator: In some cases, hydrogen atoms or other elements ‘fly away’ while running a simulation movie. (528, 558) 

8. Minimize sometimes gives partial results. For some structures it needs multiple executions of ‘minimize’ to boil down the high force to a lower value. (567) 

9. Povray file of a model neglects the user defined lighting and displays the povray image in nE-1’s default lighting. (447)

10. Jigs: Rotary and Linear motors do not move with the chunks they are attached to. (168) 

11. Selection/Jigs: Cannot select a jig (i.e. motor, ground, thermostat or thermometer) in the graphics area. Jigs may only be selected via the model tree. (6) 

12. Selection: Can not select a chunk if cursor is inside the selection polyhedron but not pointing inside perimeter of any of the atoms in that chunk. (11)

13. Selection: ‘Select Doubly’ can often take a long time to complete. (102)

14. Extrude Tool: The 'extrude a ring' feature has some bugs. These will be fixed for the Beta release of nanoENGINEER-1. To use extrude's 'Ring Mode' effectively, make sure you follow these steps: 

-- Get everything adjusted first in the 'rod mode'.  For example, select the proper bond offset sphere or arrange the copy units such that you can see their open bonds highlighted in a way you would like to bond them. (In general, while in the ring mode, adjustments made from graphics area don’t work)

-- Then, you may switch to "Ring Mode" by selecting ring from the rod pulldown menu on the dashboard. While viewing the ring, you may increase the number of copies. 

-- If you need to do any further adjustments, switch back to "Rod Mode", make changes and switch back to the "Ring Mode". 

-- Select the 'Done' button on the dashboard when finished. (155)

15. Extrude Tool: Separates the chunk permanently when atoms are partially selected and then extrude mode is cancelled. (198) 

16. Extrude Tool: Multiple chunks are automatically merged into a single chuck, even when cancel is hit. (397)

17. Exrude Tool: Extrude’s ring feature doesn’t take the curvature into account for the bonds formed. (494)

18.  Extrude Tool/Movie: Simulation movie becomes invalid if it is created while in extrude mode , after adjusting the chunks (to be extruded) as ‘bondables’ with their copy units. (495)

19. Cookie Cutter: Large selections can cause response latency. (8)

20. Cookie Cutter, Shift+Left Mouse drag only deletes drawing that is outside but doesn't draw inside the lasso/ rectangle (190) 

21. Naming: When starting a new part or opening a new file, the object name indexing is not reset to 1. For example, new chunk names continue to increment from the previous part's index number. (64)

22. Model Tree: Dragging and dropping objects onto the part icon at the top of the list places the items(s) at the bottom of the list. Similarly, dragging and dropping items onto a group folder places them at the bottom of the group, not the top.  (360)

23. Align to common axis averages the axis vectors of the selected chunks. The resultant vector is (usually) different than the axis vectors of any of the chunks. (187)

24. Cursors: Middle mouse button "Hint Cursors" can sometimes get stuck on pressing the Shift or Cntl/Cmd key will usually fix the cursor. (113, 158)

25. Cursors: The skull and crossbones cursor in build mode will not display (when pressing Ctrl/Cmd) after clicking in the Model Tree area. (217)

26. Display: Larger atoms can obscure open bonds when displayed in VdW mode. (258) 

27. Display: The front clipping plane will sometimes clip objects that should not be clipped.

28. Zoom Tool: It is still experimental. Some Mac users report cosmetic bugs. It is a good idea to save your work before using it.


Windows Only Bugs


1. During drag-and-drop, node icons are not shown in the cursor's drag object. (360)



Macintosh Only Bugs

1. Sometimes a cursor's bitmask will suddenly not work, leaving a white square around the cursor. 

2. Icon tray/bar redrawing of the icon images will show up overlapped, zig-zagged, cracked, etc. in certain situations. In worst cases, the right-side icon bars will go invisible until the invisible bar is clicked on, which redraws the bar but changes your button. 

3. Occasionally, bouncing between programs will lead to the menu (screen top) disappearing, only to re-appear with mouseover (or mouseover+click).


Linux Only Bugs


1. Opening a plot file from the plot tool dialogs needs ‘kwrite’ editor which is available with only with KDE desktop (434)
