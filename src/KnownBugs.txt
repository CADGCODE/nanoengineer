Unsupported Features:

1. Undo/Redo not implemented. 

2. Points, lines, and planes are not implemented yet. (47) 

3. Simulator will support bonding between elements specified in the element selector of nanoENGINEER-1. Multiple bonding is not supported for alpha. 

4. nanoENGINEER-1 (nE-1) treats all bond types as single bonds while reading from or writing to a PDB file. (569)

5. The symmetry information for a selected chunk cannot be obtained. (261)

6. Unicode characters are not supported for naming the items in the model tree. (474)


Known Bugs (All Platforms)

Various Delete Operations

1. Delete operation cannot be undone. In fact, Undo/Redo are not implemented yet. SAVE YOUR WORK OFTEN!

2. If you select the part icon (top icon in the model tree) and hit the delete key (or click Delete), the entire part will be deleted without asking the user for confirmation. (147) 

3. Any file currently opened by nanoENGINEER-1 can be manually deleted from the computer without any warning message. (215)

4. Only open one main window. Opening more than one nanoENGINEER-1 application window will have unexpected results. (362)

5. User can not save exclusive features of nanoENGINEER-1 into the PDB file format. Some examples of such ‘MMP file only’ features include jigs, groups, hidden states of chunks, multiple chunks, entire clipboard feature etc.  nE-1 doesn't give enough warning messages for users trying to save such features into a PDB file. (252)

6. The MMP File Format specification included in the nanoENGINEER-1 Assistant is obsolete. The most current version can be found at www.nanoengineer-1.com under Documentation section. 

7. Simulator: In some cases, hydrogen atoms or other elements ‘fly away’ while running a simulation movie. (528, 558) 

8. Jigs: Rotary and Linear motors do not move with the chunks they are attached to. However, after moving the chunks, you can reposition the motor by right clicking on the motor name in the Model Tree and then using context menu option ‘recenter on atoms’    (168) 

Selection Modes (Select Atoms and Select Chunks modes)

9. Selection: Can not select a chunk if cursor is inside the selection polyhedron but not pointing inside perimeter of any of the atoms or bonds in that chunk. (11)

10. It is difficult to select jigs (other than motors) by clicking them in the 3D workspace (graphics area) while in select atoms mode. A simple work around is to select them from the Model Tree instead of the 3D workspace (graphics area)

Extrude Mode

11.  The 'extrude a ring' feature has some bugs. These will be fixed for the Beta release of nanoENGINEER-1. To use extrude's 'Ring Mode' effectively, make sure you follow these steps: 

-- Get everything adjusted first in the 'rod mode'.  For example, select the proper bond offset sphere or arrange the copy units such that you can see their open bonds highlighted in a way you would like to bond them. (In general, while in the ring mode, adjustments made from graphics area don’t work)

-- Then, you may switch to "Ring Mode" by selecting ring from the rod pulldown menu on the dashboard. While viewing the ring, you may increase the number of copies. 

-- If you need to do any further adjustments, switch back to "Rod Mode", make changes and switch back to the "Ring Mode". 

-- Select the 'Done' button on the dashboard when finished. (155)

12. Extrude: Separates the chunk permanently when atoms are partially selected and then extrude mode is cancelled. (198) 

13. Extrude: Multiple chunks are automatically merged into a single chuck, even when cancel is hit. (397)

14. Extrude’s ring feature doesn’t take the curvature into account while forming the bonds. (494)

Movie 

15.  Extrude Tool/Movie: Simulation movie becomes invalid if it is created while in extrude mode, after adjusting the chunks (to be extruded) as ‘bondables’ with their copy units. (495)

16. Movie/Clipboard: While playing a simulation movie, if you click on a different clipboard item (rather a clipboard ‘Part’), then the movie can not be ‘viewed’. But it continues to run. nE-1 doesn’t print a warning message to instruct user to click on the appropriate ‘Part’, for which the movie is created for,  to view the movie. (578-5)

Cookie Cutter

17. Cookie Cutter: Large selections can cause response latency. (8)

18. Cookie Cutter: Right click while rotating the grid using middle mouse drag operation, changes the grid orientation (59)

19. Cookie Cutter: the 3D workspace (graphics area) turns into a black display if you resize the nE-1 window while drawing an auto shape e.g. a circle or a hexagon etc. The original display can be regained by hitting any key. (687)

Fuse Chunks Mode

20. Fuse Chunks: If the chunks were ‘merged’ in previous operation while bonding them together, ‘Back Up’ button on the dashboard doesn’t ‘unmerge’ them. It only deletes the bond formed in earlier operation. (486-10)

21. Fuse Chunks: Back up button on dashboard to delete a bond formed in previous operation deletes the bond, but it doesn’t restore the previous bond angles. (502-16)

22. Fuse Chunks can not bond elements of two or more chunks if they are already bonded. Also, some history messages are not correct.  (580)

23. Fuse Chunks: operations while in this mode are sluggish if it’s a large model and has large number of open bonds. (689)

24. Naming: When starting a new part or opening a new file, the object name indexing is not reset to 1. For example, new chunk names continue to increment from the previous part's index number. (64)

25. Model Tree: Dragging and dropping objects onto the part icon at the top of the list places the items(s) at the bottom of the list. Similarly, dragging and dropping items onto a group folder places them at the bottom of the group, not the top.  (360)

Cursor and Display related bugs:

26. Cursors: Middle mouse button "Hint Cursors" can sometimes get stuck. Usually, if you press and release the Shift or Ctrl/Cmd key, the appropriate cursor is restored.(113, 158,404)

27. Cursors: The skull and crossbones cursor in build mode will not display (when pressing Ctrl/Cmd) after clicking in the Model Tree area. (217)

28. Display: Larger atoms can obscure open bonds when displayed in VdW mode. (258) 

29. Display: Open bonds are not seen in sp, sp2 Carbon and sp2 Oxygen, when these are represented with Van der Waals display (656)

30. Display: The front clipping plane will sometimes clip objects that should not be clipped

31. Display: bond and atom center highlighting in build mode has some bugs. The highlighting flicker whenever there is a selection or valence error wire frame around the atom center. 

Dialogs and Dashboard

32. Users operating nE-1 with a low screen resolution report bugs in the dialog boxes and dashboards. In such cases, the dashboard items of some modes are not visible, tolerance slider bars don’t operate correctly, some property forms such as Molecular Modeling Kit occupy most of the space in model tree etc. (513, 581, 844)

33. Zoom Tool: Some Mac users report cosmetic bugs. It is a good idea to save your work before using it.

Povray

34.  Povray rendering of lines display is shown as black lines, motor arrows are not rendered (226, 527)

35. Povray file of a model neglects the user defined lighting and displays the povray image in nE-1’s default lighting. (447)

36. Povray: Background fill type is not saved in a povray file. Only solid background can be rendered. (888)

Modeling Kit in Build mode

This feature is still under development and has some known bugs. 
37. Sometimes this dialog box doesn’t close even after main window of ne-1 is closed. It dies away after a few seconds though. (852)

Minimize

38. For some structures minimize needs multiple executions of ‘minimize’ to boil down the high force to a lower value. (567)
39. Minimize operation for some elements with higher order bond types doesn’t work. (805)


Windows Only Bugs


1. During drag-and-drop, node icons are not shown in the cursor's drag object. (360)



Macintosh Only Bugs

1. Sometimes a cursor's bitmask will suddenly not work, leaving a white square around the cursor. 

2. Icon tray/bar redrawing of the icon images will show up overlapped, zig-zagged, cracked, etc. in certain situations. In worst cases, the right-side icon bars will go invisible until the invisible bar is clicked on, which redraws the bar but changes your button. This usually only happens when resizing the main window by dragging its "resize handle" on the lower right of the window frame. The workaround is to resize it to be a bit smaller than you want, and then make it a bit bigger again so that it's the desired size. Some users report that the toolbars always draw wrongly after that initial down-sizing, but then they always draw properly again after that final small up-sizing.

3. Occasionally, bouncing between programs will lead to the menu (screen top) disappearing, only to re-appear with mouseover (or mouseover+click).


Linux Only Bugs


1. Opening a plot file from the plot tool dialogs needs ‘kwrite’ editor which is available with only with KDE desktop (434)

2. Molecular Modeling Kit (MMKit): When you enter build mode, this dialog first appears in the middle of the 3D workspace (graphics area)  for a fraction of second and then it is moved to the left hand side of the ne-1 main window. The amount of time this dialog stays inside the 3D workspace depends on the model size. (844)
