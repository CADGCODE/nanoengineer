* Bug #


Unsupported Features:

1. Undo/Redo not implemented. 

2. Can not move, translate or rotate a chunk by editing its coordinates or providing an x, y, z offset. (9)

3. Points, lines, and planes are not implemented yet. (47) 

4. Simulator will support bonding between elements specified in the element selector of nanoENGINEER-1. Multiple bonding is not supported for alpha. 

5. The 'Clipboard' has limitations and some bugs. 

6. Do not drag and drop anything between the model tree and the clipboard. 

7. The symmetry information for a selected chunk cannot be obtained. (261)

8. sp and sp2 bonds are not supported.

9. Aromatic bonds are not supported.

10. Bonds are not selectable.

11. Linear motors are not supported by the simulator. (393) 


Known Bugs (All Platforms)

1. Delete operation cannot be undone. In fact, Undo/Redo are not implemented yet. SAVE YOUR WORK OFTEN!

2. If you select the part icon (top icon in the model tree) and hit the delete key (or click Delete), the entire part will be deleted without asking the user for confirmation. (147) 

3. During Minimize, the progress bar will stay at 0% until the last moment, then jumps to 100% before hiding. (490)

4. Only open one main window. Opening more than one nanoENGINEER-1 application window will have unexpected results. (362)

5. Dragging and dropping objects onto the part icon at the top of the list places the items(s) at the bottom of the list. Similarly, dragging and dropping items onto a group folder places them at the bottom of the group, not the top.  (360)

6. The front clipping plane will sometimes clip objects that should not be clipped.

7. Align to common axis averages the axis vectors of the selected chunks. The resultant vector is (usually) different than the axis vectors of any of the chunks. (187)

8. Any file currently opened by nanoENGINEER-1 can be manually deleted from the computer without any warning message. (215)

9. After drawing a 'cookie' in the cookie cutter, if the orientation view is changed and then any new cookie drawn will be placed at a wrong location. Thus, the user should not change the views while in the cookie cutter. (236)

10. User can not save exclusive features of nanoENGINEER-1 into the PDB file format. nanoENGINEER-1 doesn't give any warning message for users trying to save such features in a .pdb file. (252)

11. Extrude Tool: The 'extrude a ring' feature has some bugs. These will be fixed for the Beta release of nanoENGINEER-1. To use extrude's 'Ring Mode' effectively, make sure you follow these steps: 

-- Get everything adjusted first in the 'rod mode'.  For example, select the proper bond offset sphere or arrange the copy units such that you can see their open bonds highlighted in a way you would like to bond them. (In general, while in the ring mode, adjustments made from graphics area don’t work)

-- Then, you may switch to "Ring Mode" by selecting ring from the rod pulldown menu on the dashboard. While viewing the ring, you may increase the number of copies. 

-- If you need to do any further adjustments, switch back to "Rod Mode", make changes and switch back to the "Ring Mode". 

-- Select the 'Done' button on the dashboard when finished. (155)

12. Exrude Tool: extrude’s ring feature doesn’t take the curvature into account for the bonds formed. (494)

13. Extrude Tool: Multiple chunks are automatically merged into a single chuck, even when cancel is hit. (397)

14. When starting a new part or opening a new file, the object name indexing is not reset to 1. For example, new chunk names continue to increment from the previous part's index number. (64)

15. The MMP File Format specification included in the nanoENGINEER-1 Assistant is obsolete. The most current version can be found at www.nanorex.com/mmpformat.htm

16. Rotary and Linear motors do not move with the chunks they are attached to. (168) 

17. Cannot select a jig (i.e. motor, ground, thermostat or thermometer) in the graphics area. Jigs may only be selected via the model tree. (6) 

18. "Select Doubly" can often take a long time to complete. (102)

19. Middle mouse button "Hint Cursors" can sometimes get stuck on. Pressing the Shift or Cntl/Cmd key will usually fix the cursor. (113, 158)

20. Build Mode: The skull and crossbones cursor will not display (when pressing Ctrl/Cmd) after clicking in the Model Tree area. (217)

21. Cookie Mode: Changing views (Front, Top, Right, etc.) and then making a selection does not select properly. (236, 277) 

22. Cookie Mode: The thickness of the current layer does not change once selection has started, even though the thickness can be changed on the dashboard. (167)

23. Cookie Mode: When adding a new layer, there is no visual clue indicating a new layer has started. (281) 

24. Cookie Mode: Large selections can cause response latency. (8)

25. Display: Larger atoms can obscure open bonds when displayed in VdW mode. (258) 

26. Zoom Tool: It is still experimental. Some Mac users report cosmetic bugs. It is a good idea to save your work before using it.

27. Simulator: in some cases, open bonds ‘fly away’ from the elements while running a simulation movie. (254) 

28. Minimize: Large values written to the MMP (or to the generated XYZ) file after minimizing a model containing overlapped open bonds or excessively stretched bonds (422)

29. Some bugs occur if one tries to play a movie file that is not valid for an opened MMP file.( A movie file becomes invalid if you make certain modifications to the file after creating the movie e.g. add/delete atoms, reorder the model tree etc) . This may result in loss of data. Therefore, do not try to play a movie file that is invalid for the opened part. (384)

30. Can not select a chunk if cursor is inside the selection polyhedron but not pointing inside perimeter of any of the atoms in that chunk. (11)

31.  In the Cookie Cutter, Shift+Left Mouse drag only deletes drawing that is outside but doesn't draw inside the lasso/ rectangle (190) 

32. Extrude: Separates the chunk permanently when atoms are partially selected and then extrude mode is cancelled. (198) 

33. Movie player directly jumps to the last frame if, you play a movie, then create a new movie with lesser number of frames than the original one and then enter the movie player in order to play the new movie (395)


Windows Only Bugs


1. During drag-and-drop, node icons are not shown in the cursor's drag object. (360)



Macintosh Only Bugs

1. Sometimes a cursor's bitmask will suddenly not work, leaving a white square around the cursor. 

2. Icon tray/bar redrawing of the icon images will show up overlapped, zig-zagged, cracked, etc. in certain situations. In worst cases, the right-side icon bars will go invisible until the invisible bar is clicked on, which redraws the bar but changes your button. 

3. Occasionally, bouncing between programs will lead to the menu (screen top) disappearing, only to re-appear with mouseover (or mouseover+click).


Linux Only Bugs


1. Opening a plot file from the plot tool dialogs needs ‘kwrite’ editor which is available with only with KDE desktop (434)
