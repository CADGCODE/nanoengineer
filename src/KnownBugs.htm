<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=GramE>nanoENGINEER-1</span> v0.7 (Alpha 7).
Release Date: April 24, 2006</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>This file documents some bug fixes, unsupported features
and some of the commonly encountered bugs in nanoENGINEER-1 Alpha7. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Some of the Bug Fixes <span class=GramE>In</span> Alpha 7</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>1. Miscellaneous bug fixes and the user interface
enhancements in Build mode</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>2. Some bugs where <span class=SpellE>MMKit's</span>
clipboard view doesn't get updated when you do modifications in the 3D
workspace (876, 1570, and 1573)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>3. Rendered povray image doesn’t render user defined
lighting and background fill color (447-mitigated, 888)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>4. Selection/Display/Jigs: If more than 1 <span
class=GramE>jigs</span> (other than motors) are attached to the same atom, only
first jig in the order (in the model tree) gets highlighted (756) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>5. Simulator doesn't work for an opened file where the
user doesn't have permission to write. (Now nE-1 prints a red history message
when it can’t write the file)(396)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>6. Improved force field. Formal bend parameters have
replaced guessed values for all single bond combinations</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>7. Naming a File (plot tool bug): If a file is named as
Bob's molecule, the plot tool will not plot the results because of the
apostrophe S present in the file's name (712) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>UNSUPPORTED FEATURES:</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#UNDO/REDO </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- Undo/Redo knows nothing about the mode the program was
in. For example, if you extrude a moiety while in extrude, return to your
default mode and then hit Undo, it will only separate the base and repeat
units. It will not go back to extrude mode. (1391)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- <span class=SpellE>MMKit</span> tab and button changes
and most changes made in the dashboards are not recorded in the Undo stack </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- On large models, undo and other operation might become
slower. Further performance improvements will be implemented in a future
release of the software</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#<span class=SpellE>PDBs</span> <span class=GramE>With</span>
Multiple Bond Information Not Supported </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;This version of ne-1 treats all bond types as
single bonds while reading from or writing to a PDB file. Also, it doesn't save
the hybridization type into the PDB file. For example, (sp2) hybridized Carbon
in a structure will be saved as a sp3 hybridized Carbon with wrong bond
valence. <span class=GramE>(3 bonds instead of 4).</span> Also, the double bond
of this (sp2) Carbon is saved as a single bond Therefore, save your models ONLY
in MMP file format to avoid major loss of work (569, 763)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>SIMULATOR / MINIMIZE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator/Minimize: will support bonding between
elements specified in the element selector of nanoENGINEER-1. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator/Minimize: Multiple bonding between certain
elements is generally supported, but some parameters, notably for double bonds
involving nitrogen, are estimated. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator/Minimize: The simulator doesn't take into
account the effect of torsion. This will make systems with double or
aromatic/graphitic bonds act less stiff than they really would.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator: Electrostatic interactions are not
supported; in particular, the hydrogen and dative bonds are not handled. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Enable motor in minimize feature is experimental.
Enabling a motor in minimization may result in high values of <span
class=SpellE>rms</span> force. Also, minimize will take long time to finish</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Nanotubes: The simulator doesn't take into account the
effect of torsion. The simulation/minimization of nanotubes and similar
structures is not supported. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>GAMESS Jig</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#GAMESS jig can be added by select some atoms first in
'Select Atoms' mode and then attaching this jig by using Menu item: Jigs&gt;<span
class=SpellE>Gamess</span>. This jig can be attached to a maximum of 200 atoms.
</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Certain GAMESS optimization runs or Energy calculation
can take very long time (hours/days). While a GAMESS job is being performed,
user is not allowed to do any other operation in that session of ne-1. User
must wait till the GAMESS job is finished or opt to terminate it by hitting
'Cancel' button in the progress bar. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Also, certain GAMESS run may create large output
files. So make sure that your system has enough disk space to handle such runs.
ALL GAMESS jobs are <span class=GramE>save</span> inside the 'Job Manager'
directory. (User's home directory/ Nanorex/Job Manager) (742)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ESP IMAGE / NANO-HIVE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># ESP Image jig is not fully supported on Linux and MAC
platforms. On Windows, you can perform ESP calculations for some standard cases
provided that a correct version of <span class=SpellE>NanoHive</span> is
installed. In general ESP image is partially supported and has many known bugs.
These issues will be fixed in an upcoming release of nanoENGINEER-1.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Bond Inference not supported but a limited valence
error check supported. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>By the term 'bond inference' we mean automatically
deciding what type of bond will be formed between the participating elements.
It is not supported for this version of ne-1. When an element is deposited, by
default, all the bonds are single bonds. User must manually change the bond
type between the elements in 'Build mode'. However, if the structure is not
chemically correct (bad valences etc), ne-1 shows a 'pink wire frame' around
each atom indicating valence errors.&nbsp; This 'valence error' display, by
default, is enabled. It can be changed from the 'Bonds' tab in the Preferences
dialog. (Edit&gt;Preference…). &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Note that there are some kinds of chemical errors this
(the Valence Error Checker) doesn't detect. For example, it can't tell whether
rings should be aromatic or not. All it checks is that the bonds on each atom
could possibly add up to the right number of valence electrons. The Valence Error
Checker doesn't treat graphitic and aromatic bonds differently.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>      </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MISCELLANEOUS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Unicode characters are not supported for naming the
items in the model tree. (474)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># nanoENGINEER-1 Alpha7 is tested and supported only on
Windows XP, MAC OS X 10.3.X, 10.4 and Mandrake Linux 10.0, 10.1. It is not
supported on Intel based <span class=SpellE>MACs</span> (e.g. <span
class=SpellE>Macbook</span> pro).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There
are some known issues on other operating systems such as Fedora Core 4, <span
class=SpellE>Gentoo</span> Linux (e.g. the program hangs or some display issues
etc).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1049, 1058, 1201, 1724)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>KNOWN BUGS (ALL PLATFORMS)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MEMORY AND PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=GramE># Memory consumed by the application
increases due to repeated execution of certain operations such as opening and
closing a file (often termed as ‘memory leaks’.</span> This affects the overall
performance of the software and could result in a crash. This version doesn’t
prevent such memory leaks. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># nE-1 has some known performance problems while using
some features. As a result, some operations take considerably longer times.
This is particularly true when you are handling a large file. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Examples: Opening a large file, Operations performed in
Fuse mode, moving selected atoms, Selecting and deselecting some atoms from a
large chunk, deleting some atoms, Undoing or redoing these operations, playing
a movie on a large model etc. may take longer time when the file size is large.
(991, 1473, 1674, 1704, 1750, 1778)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#Movie playing is lot slower for large models on some low
system configuration machines. Also, other normal operations such as opening a
file become slower for such machines (1757)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ESP IMAGE JIG (NANO-HIVE)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ESP image has many known bugs or unimplemented features.
Some Examples: </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- ESP calculations on some structures is not done and a
black ESP image is created</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- Program switches to <span class=GramE>Build</span> mode
while inserting an ESP jig </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- Some bugs in the ESP dialog box options and
implementation</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MINIMIZE/SIMULATOR</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>(<span class=GramE>see</span> also: the Unsupported
Features section)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>For</span> some structures it needs
multiple executions of 'minimize' to boil down the high force to a lower value.
Sometimes, even after repeated minimize operations, it gives high <span
class=SpellE>rms</span> and high force <span class=GramE>values(</span>1892)&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Quite</span> often, the <span
class=SpellE>rms</span> &amp; high force inconsistently increase during each
execution of 'minimize'. Thus minimizing a structure could result in a new
structure with a higher RMS force value than the input structure.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It should be the case that the new structure
will always have a lower potential energy than the input structure, even if the
RMS force value may sometimes be higher. This will be fixed in a future release
of the product. (1377)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Minimize</span> operation for some
elements with higher order bond types doesn't work. See 'Unsupported Features'
section for more info. (805)&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator: In some cases, hydrogen atoms or other
elements 'fly away' while running a simulation movie. This happens when atom
centers are very close and therefore the repulsive force becomes very high
(528, 558) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Rotary motor doesn't rotate if a thermostat is attached
to the chunk. Workaround is not to attach a thermostat jig when a rotary motor
is present (1889)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Linear motor doesn't move the atoms if a thermostat jig
is attached (1893)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Enable motor in minimize feature is experimental and
has some bugs. Examples- the final <span class=SpellE>rms</span> and high force
values after minimize are large, it takes long time to finish minimize
operation. (1835, 1836)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>SELECTION </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Selection: Can not select a chunk by clicking on any of
the bonds in that chunk. (11) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#Selection wireframes won't be displayed or will act
weirdly on some platforms. This could be due to the old version graphics driver
on your machine. Example: Some Windows XP users with Intel Integrated 855
graphics reported this problem which went away after installing an updated
version of that driver (Intel 855 chipset driver 6.14.10.4497.). It is highly recommended
that you use up-to-date drivers to avoid this issue (1720)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Contract Selection doesn't work correctly in some
cases. Also the <span class=GramE>What's</span> this text doesn't clearly
explain this feature. (1358)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>BUILD MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Highlighting</span> in Build mode is
problematic in some cases. Examples: 1) When more than one nanoENGINEER-1
applications are running. 2) If vertical splitter of the Model Tree is dragged
to adjust Model Tree's width 3) If Main nE-1 window is maximized etc. (1241,
1243, <span class=GramE>1637</span>)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Zoom/Pan/Rotate Tools in Build mode: If you click on
Zoom, Pan or Rotate tools while in Build, the <span class=SpellE>MMKit</span>
and other Build features will become temporarily unavailable while you use
these tools. (1518)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Build: In lines <span class=GramE>display ,</span> the
atom center doesn't get highlighted (if the atom is not selected). Thus, you
can not perform operations such as change <span class=GramE>hybridization ,</span>
move the atom while in lines mode<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Simple
workaround is to change the display representation to Tubes or CPK or <span
class=SpellE>Ball&amp;Stick</span>.(1837) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Build/ Bond <span class=GramE>Order :</span> The
context menu 'Reposition <span class=SpellE>Bondpoints</span>' of an atom
reorients the <span class=SpellE>bondpoints</span> but while doing so, it makes
the bondpoint type as single.&nbsp; Let's assume that a Carbon atom with (sp2)
hybridization is deposited in build mode. Now you highlight one of its <span
class=SpellE>bondpoints</span>, right click and select 'double bond' from the
context menu. The representation of the bondpoint will change to a 'double
bondpoint'. Now, if you highlight the atom center, right click and select
'reposition <span class=SpellE>bondpoints</span>', it will clear the 'double
bondpoint' representation you just made and thus, all three <span class=SpellE>bondpoints</span>
of (sp2) carbon will be represented as single bond type. (839) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MOLECULAR MODELING KIT IN BUILD MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>This feature has some known bugs. Also refer to Linux
Only Bugs and 'Dialogs and Dashboards' bug sections for some related issues. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=SpellE>MMKit</span>: Sometimes this dialog
box doesn't close even after main window of ne-1 is closed. It goes away after
a few seconds though. (852) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>If</span> an MMP file in the <span
class=SpellE>MMKit’s</span> library has jigs those won’t be pasted along with
the part. Also, group records won’t be available when you paste a part from the
library (1164, 1080)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=SpellE>MMKit</span>: <span class=SpellE>MMKit’s</span>
3-D thumbnail view doesn’t get updated in some cases<span class=GramE>.(</span>1848)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Library tab: If the library tab is showing a large model
in the thumbnail <span class=GramE>view ,</span> you switch to some other tab
and then return to the library tab, it might take long time to open that tab.
(939)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=GramE>#<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Modeling</span> Kit: For lower resolution screens the Modeling kit
occupies most of the Model Tree space, thus obscures most of the Model Tree
area.(1437) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Modeling Kit: If the 'Clipboard' tab of Build mode's
Modeling Kit dialog is open and then you hit a keyboard modifier key (e.g. C,
'S', '1' etc), the program is supposed to switch back to 'Atoms' tab. But in
some cases, it doesn't because of a <span class=SpellE>keyfocus</span> issue.
In order to overcome this bug, try clicking inside 3D workspace once, then hit
a modifier key. Now it should change to 'Atoms' tab. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MOVE MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Move: Keyboard modifier keys that constrain translation
or rotation around an axis (e.g. press 'Y' and 'R' to rotate the selected chunk
around Y axis.), doesn't work for the first time after you perform 'delta +' or
<span class=GramE>'delta ,</span>' operations (which move a chunk by a specific
distance). A workaround is to press and release the modifier keys and then
press them again to perform these operations. (674) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>EXTRUDE MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=GramE># &nbsp;The</span> 'extrude a ring'
feature has some bugs. These will be fixed for the Beta release of
nanoENGINEER-1. To use <span class=SpellE>extrude's</span> 'Ring Mode'
effectively, make sure you follow these steps: &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Get everything adjusted first in the 'rod mode'.&nbsp;
For example, select the proper bond offset sphere or arrange the copy units
such that you can see their <span class=SpellE>bondpoints</span> highlighted in
a way you would like to bond them. (In general, while in the ring mode,
adjustments made from graphics area don't work)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Then, you may switch to &quot;Ring Mode&quot; by
selecting ring from the rod pull-down menu on the dashboard. While viewing the
ring, you may increase the number of copies. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- If you need to do any further adjustments, switch back
to &quot;Rod Mode&quot;, make changes and switch back to the &quot;Ring
Mode&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Select the 'Done' button on the dashboard when
finished. (155)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Extrude: Separates the chunk permanently when atoms are
partially selected and then extrude mode is cancelled. (198) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Extrude: Multiple chunks are automatically merged into
a single chuck, even when cancel is hit. (397) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=SpellE>Extrude's</span> ring feature
doesn't take the curvature into account while forming the bonds. (494) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>COOKIE CUTTER</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Cookie Cutter: Large selections can cause response
latency. (8) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Cookie Cutter: Right click while rotating the grid
using middle mouse drag operation, changes the grid orientation (59) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Cookie Cutter/Display bug: the 3D workspace (graphics
area) turns into a black display if you resize the ne-1 window while drawing an
auto shape e.g. a circle or a hexagon etc. The original display can be regained
by hitting any key. (687) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>FUSE CHUNKS MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Fuse Chunks: operations while in this mode are sluggish
if it's a large model. However, its performance is improved compared to Alpha6
(689) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Fuse Chunks: If the chunks were 'merged' in previous
operation while bonding them together, 'Back Up' button on the dashboard
doesn't 'unmerge' them. It only deletes the bond formed in earlier operation.
(486-10) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Fuse Chunks: Back up button on dashboard to delete a
bond formed in previous operation deletes the bond, but it doesn't restore the
previous bond angles. (502-16) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Fuse Chunks can not bond elements of two or more chunks
if they are already bonded. Also, some history messages are not correct.&nbsp;
(580) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MOVIE PLAYER</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Movie playing is lot slower for large models on some
low system configuration machines (1757)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Extrude Tool/Movie: Simulation movie becomes invalid if
it is created while in extrude mode, after adjusting the chunks (to be
extruded) as 'bondable' with their copy units. (495) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Movie/Clipboard: While playing a simulation movie, if
you click on a different clipboard item (rather a clipboard 'Part'), then the
movie can not be 'viewed'. But it continues to run. <span class=GramE>ne-1</span>
doesn't print a warning message to instruct user to click on the appropriate
'Part', for which the movie is created for,&nbsp; to view the movie. (578-5) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=GramE>#<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Movie</span>: If you run a simulation and then modify the model further
(e.g. delete some atoms etc), the movie becomes invalid.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=GramE>ne-1</span> generally
identifies such situations. But in certain cases, it doesn't.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Some Examples: After creating a simulation
movie, if you 'Hydrogenate' some chunks or change the bond types or 'transmute'
some elements to a different one. To avoid this, always rerun a simulation
after doing such modifications for the correct results. (901)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>NAMING</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Naming</span> of created items: When
starting a new part or opening a new file, the object name indexing is not
reset to 1. For example, new chunk names continue to increment from the
previous part's index number. (64) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Naming</span> GAMESS Jigs: If a <span
class=SpellE>Gamess</span> jig contains a Forward or Backward Slash in it (e.g.
'AM1/None'), then the <span class=SpellE>Gamess</span> job will fail. So do not
include these characters while naming this jig. (796) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Model Tree: Dragging and dropping objects onto the part
icon at the top of the list places the items(s) at the bottom of the list.
Similarly, dragging and dropping items onto a group folder places them at the
bottom of the group, not the top.&nbsp; (360) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>CURSOR AND DISPLAY RELATED BUGS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Cursors: Middle mouse button &quot;Hint Cursors&quot;
can sometimes get stuck. Usually, if you press and release the Shift or Ctrl/<span
class=SpellE>Cmd</span> key, the appropriate cursor is restored<span
class=GramE>.(</span>113, 158,404) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Display: The front clipping plane will sometimes clip
objects that should not be clipped &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Display: <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Valence</st1:place></st1:City>
error wire frame is displayed even for invisible atoms. Also, while Build mode
when you move cursor inside such a wire frame, even the invisible atom center
gets highlighted. (870) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>DIALOGS AND DASHBOARD</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Users operating ne-1 with a low screen resolution and
large font size report bugs in the dialog boxes and dashboards. In such cases,
the dashboard items of some modes are not visible, tolerance slider bars don't
operate correctly, some property forms such as Modeling Kit occupy most of the
space in model tree etc. (513, 581, <span class=GramE>844</span>) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>POVRAY RENDERING</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#&nbsp;Povray rendering doesn't show different bond types
(it will be supported feature for this version) (830) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Povray rendering of lines display is shown as black
lines (226)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Motor arrows are not rendered (527) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>If</span> a motor is attached to only
a single atom, povray image can not be rendered (719)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Povray image rendered incorrectly in some orientations
of the linear motor (1755)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Measurement jigs, ESP Image <span class=GramE>Volume(</span>outline)
and Grid lines in a grid plane jig are not rendered in the generated povray
file.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1084, 1196, 1198)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MISCELLANEOUS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># User can not save exclusive features of nanoENGINEER-1
into the PDB file format. Some examples of such 'MMP file only' features
include jigs, groups, hidden states of chunks, multiple chunks, entire
clipboard feature etc.&nbsp; <span class=GramE>ne-1</span> doesn't give enough
warning messages for users trying to save such features into a PDB file. (252)
&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Only</span> open one main window.
Opening more than one nanoENGINEER-1 application window will have unexpected
results. (362) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Any</span> file currently opened by
nanoENGINEER-1 can be manually deleted from the computer without any warning
message. (215) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>WINDOWS ONLY BUGS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>On</span> some machines, the program
crashes after while running repeated simulations in some special cases. (1753) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>During</span> drag-and-drop, node
icons are not shown in the cursor's drag object. (360) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>On</span> very rear occasions, the
File&gt;Open, Save, Save dialogs don't pop up because of some python.exe
application problems. It might happen if you are working with a huge file with
lots of GAMESS jigs in it. Again, it is very unlikely to happen. Saving your
work often while working on large file is recommended. (774) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MACINTOSH ONLY BUGS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Sometimes</span> a cursor's bitmask
will suddenly not work, leaving a white square around the cursor. (772)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>On</span> iMac the 'material <span
class=SpellE>specular</span> highlighting' doesn't show up (1866). </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Icon toolbar redrawing of the icon images will show up
overlapped, <span class=SpellE>zig-zagged</span>, cracked, etc. in certain
situations. In worst cases, the right-side icon bars will go invisible until
the invisible bar is clicked on, which redraws the bar but changes your button.
This usually only happens when resizing the main window by dragging its
&quot;resize handle&quot; on the lower right of the window frame. The
workaround is to resize it to be a bit smaller than you want, and then make it
a bit bigger again so that it's the desired size. Some users report that the
toolbars always draw wrongly after that initial down-sizing, but then they
always draw properly again after that final small up-sizing. (861)&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Occasionally</span>, bouncing between
programs will lead to the menu (screen top) disappearing, only to re-appear
with <span class=SpellE>mouseover</span> (or <span class=SpellE>mouseover+click</span>).
&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># On Mac OS X Tiger, the tool buttons don't look
'pressed'. On other platforms this is not a problem. <span class=GramE>ne-1</span>
provides a workaround for this. In the 3D Workspace (i.e. Graphics area), press
Shift and Option keys and do Command click to bring up the debug menu. Now
select the &quot;Mac OS 10.4 <span class=SpellE>QToolbutton</span>
Workaround&quot; command from this debug menu. This will resolve the issue.
(878) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># On some <span class=SpellE><span class=GramE>MACs</span></span><span
class=GramE> ,</span> some cursors and icons in <span class=SpellE>MMKit</span>
and dashboard are not displayed (1824, 1838)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>LINUX ONLY BUGS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># System crashes while accessing <span class=SpellE>wiki</span>
help via the URL provided in <span class=GramE>What's</span> this text of that
mode. Workaround is to use the Mode specific <span class=SpellE>Wiki</span>
Help dialog that pops up when you hit F1 key (1447)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># nanoENGINEER-1 sometimes crashes while operating on a
bigger file and extensively using features such as clipboard, copy, extrude,
select, undo etc. (1885)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># <span class=GramE>Minimize</span> progress messages in
the status bar is truncated for lower resolution and larger font size
(1794)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Status bar text on bottom right corner can get obscured
during minimize or simulation and thus affects the display of (for example) the
minimize progress.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(1282)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#Opening a plot file from the plot tool dialogs needs '<span
class=SpellE>kwrite</span>' editor which is available with only with KDE
desktop (434) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Modeling Kit in Build Mode: When you enter build mode,
this dialog first appears in the middle of the 3D workspace (graphics
area)&nbsp;for a fraction of second and then it is moved to the left hand side
of the ne-1 main window. The amount of time this dialog stays inside the 3D
workspace depends on the model size. (844) </p>
