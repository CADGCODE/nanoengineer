<p class=MsoPlainText>NanoEngineer-1 v0.8 (Alpha 8). Release Date: July 13,
2006 (For Mac and Linux)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>This file documents some bug fixes, unsupported features
and some of the commonly encountered bugs in NanoEngineer-1 Alpha8. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Some of the Bug Fixes In Alpha 8</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>1. Simulator/Minimize: The simulator doesn't take into
account the effect of torsion. This will make systems with double or
aromatic/graphitic bonds act less stiff than they really would. (Although
torsion and out of plane terms are included, please note that this still has
some known bugs. For example, minimize returning high values for some
structures or taking long time to finish)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>2. Bond type changing tools in Build mode don’t work on
bondpoints (833-1)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>3. Povray rendering doesn't show different bond types (it
will be supported feature for this version) (830) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>4. Can not copy named view to the clipboard (1369)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>5. Movie playing gets slower because of the progress bar
(1898)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>6. Can not 'Move Absolute' the selection to (x,y,z) if a
motor is present (1990)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>UNSUPPORTED FEATURES:</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#UNDO/REDO </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- Undo/Redo knows nothing about the mode the program was
in. For example, if you extrude a moiety while in extrude, return to your
default mode and then hit Undo, it will only separate the base and repeat
units. It will not go back to extrude mode. (1391)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- MMKit tab and button changes and most changes made in
the dashboards are not recorded in the Undo stack </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- On large models, undo and other operation might become
slower. Further performance improvements will be implemented in a future
release of the software</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#PDBs With Multiple Bond Information Not Supported </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;This version of NE1 treats all bond types as single
bonds while reading from or writing to a PDB file. Also, it doesn't save the
hybridization type into the PDB file. For example, (sp2) hybridized Carbon in a
structure will be saved as a sp3 hybridized Carbon with wrong bond valence. (3
bonds instead of 4). Also, the double bond of this (sp2) Carbon is saved as a
single bond Therefore, save your models ONLY in MMP file format to avoid major
loss of work (569, 763)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>SIMULATOR / MINIMIZE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator/Minimize: will support bonding between
elements specified in the element selector of NanoEngineer-1. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator/Minimize: Multiple bonding between certain
elements is generally supported, but some parameters are estimated. The history
message during a simulation run notifies user if it is using an
estimated/reduced quality parameter. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator: Electrostatic interactions are not
supported; in particular, the hydrogen and dative bonds are not handled. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Enable motor in minimize feature is experimental.
Enabling a motor in minimization may result in high values of rms force. Also,
minimize will take long time to finish.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Various DNA structures can be modeled in NanoEngineer-1
but minimization/simulations of the generated structures is not supported. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>GAMESS Jig</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#GAMESS jig can be added by select some atoms first in
'Select Atoms' mode and then attaching this jig by using Menu item:
Jigs&gt;Gamess. This jig can be attached to a maximum of 200 atoms. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Certain GAMESS optimization runs or Energy calculation
can take very long time (hours/days). While a GAMESS job is being performed,
user is not allowed to do any other operation in that session of NE1. User must
wait till the GAMESS job is finished or opt to terminate it by hitting 'Cancel'
button in the progress bar. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Also, certain GAMESS run may create large output
files. So make sure that your system has enough disk space to handle such runs.
ALL GAMESS jobs are save inside the 'Job Manager' directory. (User's home
directory/ Nanorex/Job Manager) (742)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ESP IMAGE / NANO-HIVE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># ESP Image jig is not fully supported on Linux and MAC
platforms. On Windows, you can perform ESP calculations for some standard cases
provided that a correct version of NanoHive is installed. In general ESP image
is partially supported and has many known bugs. These issues will be fixed in
an upcoming release of NanoEngineer-1.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Bond Inference not supported but a limited valence
error check supported. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>By the term 'bond inference' we mean automatically
deciding what type of bond will be formed between the participating elements.
It is not supported for this version of NE1. When an element is deposited, by
default, all the bonds are single bonds. User must manually change the bond
type between the elements in 'Build mode'. However, if the structure is not
chemically correct (bad valences etc), NE1 shows a 'pink wire frame' around
each atom indicating valence errors.&nbsp; This 'valence error' display, by
default, is enabled. It can be changed from the 'Bonds' tab in the Preferences
dialog. (Edit&gt;Preference…). &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Note that there are some kinds of chemical errors this
(the Valence Error Checker) doesn't detect. For example, it can't tell whether
rings should be aromatic or not. All it checks is that the bonds on each atom
could possibly add up to the right number of valence electrons. The Valence
Error Checker doesn't treat graphitic and aromatic bonds differently.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MISCELLANEOUS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Unicode characters are not supported for naming the
items in the model tree. (474)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># NanoEngineer-1 Alpha7 is tested and supported only on
Windows XP, MAC OS X 10.3.X, 10.4 and Mandrake Linux 10.0, 10.1. It is not
supported on Intel based MACs (e.g. Macbook pro).&nbsp; There are some known
issues on other operating systems such as Fedora Core 4, Gentoo Linux (e.g. the
program hangs or some display issues etc).&nbsp; (1049, 1058, 1201, 1724)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>KNOWN BUGS (ALL PLATFORMS)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MEMORY AND PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Memory consumed by the application increases due to
repeated execution of certain operations such as opening and closing a file
(often termed as ‘memory leaks’. This affects the overall performance of the
software and could result in a crash. This version doesn’t prevent such memory
leaks. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># NE1 has some known performance problems while using
some features. As a result, some operations take considerably longer times.
This is particularly true when you are handling a large file. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Examples: Opening a large file, Operations performed in
Fuse mode, moving selected atoms, Selecting and deselecting some atoms from a
large chunk, deleting some atoms, Undoing or redoing these operations, playing
a movie on a large model etc. may take longer time when the file size is large.
(991, 1473, 1674, 1704, 1750, 1778)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#Movie playing is lot slower for large models on some low
system configuration machines. Also, other normal operations such as opening a
file become slower for such machines (1757)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ESP IMAGE JIG (NANO-HIVE)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ESP image has many known bugs or unimplemented features.
Some Examples: </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- ESP calculations on some structures is not done and a
black ESP image is created</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- Program switches to Build mode while inserting an ESP
jig </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>- Some bugs in the ESP dialog box options and
implementation</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MINIMIZE/SIMULATOR</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>(see also: the Unsupported Features section)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># For some structures it needs multiple executions of
'minimize' to boil down the high force to a lower value. Sometimes, even after
repeated minimize operations, it gives high rms and high force
values(1892)&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Quite often, the rms &amp; high force inconsistently
increase during each execution of 'minimize'. Thus minimizing a structure could
result in a new structure with a higher RMS force value than the input
structure.&nbsp; It should be the case that the new structure will always have
a lower potential energy than the input structure, even if the RMS force value
may sometimes be higher. This will be fixed in a future release of the product.
(1377)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Simulator: In some cases, hydrogen atoms or other
elements 'fly away' while running a simulation movie. This happens when atom
centers are very close and therefore the repulsive force becomes very high
(528, 558) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Rotary motor doesn't rotate if a thermostat is attached
to the chunk. Workaround is not to attach a thermostat jig when a rotary motor
is present (1889)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Linear motor doesn't move the atoms if a thermostat jig
is attached (1893)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Linear Motor: Even when there are two parts far enough
apart that they shouldn't interact too much, the presence or absence of one
part strongly affects the linear motor behavior. In such cases, the linear
motor doesn’t move the attached atoms (1895)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Enable motor in minimize feature is experimental and
has some bugs. Examples- the final rms and high force values after minimize are
large, it takes long time to finish minimize operation. (1835, 1836)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># For some structures with multiple bonds, minimize takes
very long time. This is true even for the smaller structures. (1957)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#During a simulation run, temperature of some structures
especially with aromatic or graphitic bonds increases. This is undesirable and
will be fixed in an upcoming release (2029)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Minimize doesn’t always honor the specified value of
EndRMS in the Energy Dialog. For example, if EndRMS value is specified as 1pN,
for some structures, minimize may terminate early and return a final RMS value
greater than 1pN (2038)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>SELECTION </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Selection: Can not select a chunk by clicking on any of
the bonds in that chunk. (11) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#Selection wireframes won't be displayed or will act
weirdly on some platforms. This could be due to the old version graphics driver
on your machine. Example: Some Windows XP users with Intel Integrated 855
graphics reported this problem which went away after installing an updated
version of that driver (Intel 855 chipset driver 6.14.10.4497.). It is highly
recommended that you use up-to-date drivers to avoid this issue (1720)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Contract Selection doesn't work correctly in some
cases. Also the What's this text doesn't clearly explain this feature. (1358)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># It is tough to select chunks with Cylinder display
(2004)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>BUILD MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Highlighting in Build mode is problematic in some
cases. Examples: 1) When more than one NanoEngineer-1 applications are running.
2) If vertical splitter of the Model Tree is dragged to adjust Model Tree's
width 3) If Main NE1 window is maximized etc. (1241, 1243, 1637)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Zoom/Pan/Rotate Tools in Build mode: If you click on
Zoom, Pan or Rotate tools while in Build, the MMKit and other Build features
will become temporarily unavailable while you use these tools. (1518)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Build: In lines display , the atom center doesn't get
highlighted (if the atom is not selected). Thus, you can not perform operations
such as change hybridization , move the atom while in lines mode&nbsp; Simple
workaround is to change the display representation to Tubes or CPK or
Ball&amp;Stick.(1837) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Build/ Bond Order : The context menu 'Reposition
Bondpoints' of an atom reorients the bondpoints but while doing so, it makes
the bondpoint type as single.&nbsp; Let's assume that a Carbon atom with (sp2)
hybridization is deposited in build mode. Now you highlight one of its
bondpoints, right click and select 'double bond' from the context menu. The
representation of the bondpoint will change to a 'double bondpoint'. Now, if you
highlight the atom center, right click and select 'reposition bondpoints', it
will clear the 'double bondpoint' representation you just made and thus, all
three bondpoints of (sp2) carbon will be represented as single bond type. (839)
</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MOLECULAR MODELING KIT IN BUILD MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>This feature has some known bugs. Also refer to Linux
Only Bugs and 'Dialogs and Dashboards' bug sections for some related issues. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># MMKit: Sometimes this dialog box doesn't close even
after main window of NE1 is closed. It goes away after a few seconds though.
(852) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># If an MMP file in the MMKit’s library has jigs those
won’t be pasted along with the part. Also, group records won’t be available
when you paste a part from the library (1164, 1080)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># MMKit: MMKit’s 3-D thumbnail view doesn’t get updated
in some cases.(1848)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Library tab: If the library tab is showing a large
model in the thumbnail view , you switch to some other tab and then return to
the library tab, it might take long time to open that tab. (939)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#&nbsp; Modeling Kit: For lower resolution screens the
Modeling kit occupies most of the Model Tree space, thus obscures most of the
Model Tree area.(1437) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Modeling Kit: If the 'Clipboard' tab of Build mode's
Modeling Kit dialog is open and then you hit a keyboard modifier key (e.g. C,
'S', '1' etc), the program is supposed to switch back to 'Atoms' tab. But in
some cases, it doesn't because of a keyfocus issue. In order to overcome this
bug, try clicking inside 3D workspace once, then hit a modifier key. Now it
should change to 'Atoms' tab. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MOVE MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Move: Keyboard modifier keys that constrain translation
or rotation around an axis (e.g. press 'Y' and 'R' to rotate the selected chunk
around Y axis.), doesn't work for the first time after you perform 'delta +' or
'delta ,' operations (which move a chunk by a specific distance). A workaround
is to press and release the modifier keys and then press them again to perform
these operations. (674) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>EXTRUDE MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># &nbsp;The 'extrude a ring' feature has some bugs. These
will be fixed for the Beta release of NanoEngineer-1. To use extrude's 'Ring
Mode' effectively, make sure you follow these steps: &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Get everything adjusted first in the 'rod mode'.&nbsp;
For example, select the proper bond offset sphere or arrange the copy units
such that you can see their bondpoints highlighted in a way you would like to
bond them. (In general, while in the ring mode, adjustments made from graphics
area don't work)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Then, you may switch to &quot;Ring Mode&quot; by
selecting ring from the rod pull-down menu on the dashboard. While viewing the
ring, you may increase the number of copies. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- If you need to do any further adjustments, switch back
to &quot;Rod Mode&quot;, make changes and switch back to the &quot;Ring
Mode&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>-- Select the 'Done' button on the dashboard when
finished. (155)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Extrude: Separates the chunk permanently when atoms are
partially selected and then extrude mode is cancelled. (198) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Extrude: Multiple chunks are automatically merged into
a single chuck, even when cancel is hit. (397) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Extrude's ring feature doesn't take the curvature into
account while forming the bonds. (494) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>COOKIE CUTTER</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Cookie Cutter: Large selections can cause response
latency. (8) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Cookie Cutter: Right click while rotating the grid
using middle mouse drag operation, changes the grid orientation (59) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Cookie Cutter/Display bug: the 3D workspace (graphics
area) turns into a black display if you resize the NE1 window while drawing an
auto shape e.g. a circle or a hexagon etc. The original display can be regained
by hitting any key. (687) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>FUSE CHUNKS MODE</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Fuse Chunks: operations while in this mode are sluggish
if it's a large model. However, its performance is improved compared to Alpha6
(689) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Fuse Chunks: If the chunks were 'merged' in previous
operation while bonding them together, 'Back Up' button on the dashboard
doesn't 'unmerge' them. It only deletes the bond formed in earlier operation.
(486-10) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Fuse Chunks: Back up button on dashboard to delete a
bond formed in previous operation deletes the bond, but it doesn't restore the
previous bond angles. (502-16) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Fuse Chunks can not bond elements of two or more chunks
if they are already bonded. Also, some history messages are not correct.&nbsp;
(580) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MOVIE PLAYER</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Movie playing is lot slower for large models on some
low system configuration machines (1757)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Extrude Tool/Movie: Simulation movie becomes invalid if
it is created while in extrude mode, after adjusting the chunks (to be
extruded) as 'bondable' with their copy units. (495) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Movie/Clipboard: While playing a simulation movie, if
you click on a different clipboard item (rather a clipboard 'Part'), then the
movie can not be 'viewed'. But it continues to run. NE1 doesn't print a warning
message to instruct user to click on the appropriate 'Part', for which the
movie is created for,&nbsp; to view the movie. (578-5) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#&nbsp; Movie: If you run a simulation and then modify
the model further (e.g. delete some atoms etc), the movie becomes
invalid.&nbsp; NE1 generally identifies such situations. But in certain cases,
it doesn't.&nbsp; Some Examples: After creating a simulation movie, if you
'Hydrogenate' some chunks or change the bond types or 'transmute' some elements
to a different one. To avoid this, always rerun a simulation after doing such
modifications for the correct results. (901)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>NAMING</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Naming of created items: When starting a new part or
opening a new file, the object name indexing is not reset to 1. For example,
new chunk names continue to increment from the previous part's index number.
(64) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Naming GAMESS Jigs: If a Gamess jig contains a Forward
or Backward Slash in it (e.g. 'AM1/None'), then the Gamess job will fail. So do
not include these characters while naming this jig. (796) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Model Tree: Dragging and dropping objects onto the part
icon at the top of the list places the items(s) at the bottom of the list.
Similarly, dragging and dropping items onto a group folder places them at the
bottom of the group, not the top.&nbsp; (360) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>CURSOR AND DISPLAY RELATED BUGS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Cursors: Middle mouse button &quot;Hint Cursors&quot;
can sometimes get stuck. Usually, if you press and release the Shift or
Ctrl/Cmd key, the appropriate cursor is restored.(113, 158,404) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Display: The front clipping plane will sometimes clip
objects that should not be clipped &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Display: Valence error wire frame is displayed even for
invisible atoms. Also, while Build mode when you move cursor inside such a wire
frame, even the invisible atom center gets highlighted. (870) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>DIALOGS AND DASHBOARD</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Users operating NE1 with a low screen resolution and
large font size report bugs in the dialog boxes and dashboards. In such cases,
the dashboard items of some modes are not visible, tolerance slider bars don't
operate correctly, some property forms such as Modeling Kit occupy most of the
space in model tree etc. (513, 581, 844) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># There are some bugs in the Nanotube, DNA,
Heterojunction and Graphene dialogs. For example dialog doesn’t go away after
doing certain operations involving ‘preview’, file getting modified even after
cancelling the dialog, bugs in history messages etc. (2045, 2054, 2057)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>POVRAY RENDERING</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Povray rendering of lines display is shown as black
lines (226)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Motor arrows are not rendered (527) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># If a motor is attached to only a single atom, povray
image can not be rendered (719)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Povray image rendered incorrectly in some orientations
of the linear motor (1755)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Measurement jigs, ESP Image Volume(outline) and Grid
lines in a grid plane jig are not rendered in the generated povray file.&nbsp;
(1084, 1196, 1198)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Chunks with Cylinder display are not rendered. (2003)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MISCELLANEOUS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># User can not save exclusive features of NanoEngineer-1 into
the PDB file format. Some examples of such 'MMP file only' features include
jigs, groups, hidden states of chunks, multiple chunks, entire clipboard
feature etc.&nbsp; NE1 doesn't give enough warning messages for users trying to
save such features into a PDB file. (252) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Only open one main window. Opening more than one
NanoEngineer-1 application window will have unexpected results. (362) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Any file currently opened by NanoEngineer-1 can be
manually deleted from the computer without any warning message. (215) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># View &gt; NormalTo doesn’t work when multiple chunks
are selected. (1748)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Insert &gt; Heterojunction and Insert &gt; DNA has some
known bugs. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>WINDOWS ONLY BUGS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># On some machines, the program crashes after while
running repeated simulations in some special cases. (1753) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># During drag-and-drop, node icons are not shown in the
cursor's drag object. (360) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># On very rear occasions, the File&gt;Open, Save, Save
dialogs don't pop up because of some python.exe application problems. It might
happen if you are working with a huge file with lots of GAMESS jigs in it.
Again, it is very unlikely to happen. Saving your work often while working on
large file is recommended. (774) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>MACINTOSH ONLY BUGS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Sometimes a cursor's bitmask will suddenly not work,
leaving a white square around the cursor. (772)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># On iMac the 'material specular highlighting' doesn't
show up (1866). </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Icon toolbar redrawing of the icon images will show up
overlapped, zig-zagged, cracked, etc. in certain situations. In worst cases,
the right-side icon bars will go invisible until the invisible bar is clicked
on, which redraws the bar but changes your button. This usually only happens
when resizing the main window by dragging its &quot;resize handle&quot; on the
lower right of the window frame. The workaround is to resize it to be a bit
smaller than you want, and then make it a bit bigger again so that it's the
desired size. Some users report that the toolbars always draw wrongly after
that initial down-sizing, but then they always draw properly again after that
final small up-sizing. (861)&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Occasionally, bouncing between programs will lead to
the menu (screen top) disappearing, only to re-appear with mouseover (or
mouseover+click). &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># On Mac OS X Tiger, the tool buttons don't look
'pressed'. On other platforms this is not a problem. NE1 provides a workaround
for this. In the 3D Workspace (i.e. Graphics area), press Shift and Option keys
and do Command click to bring up the debug menu. Now select the &quot;Mac OS
10.4 QToolbutton Workaround&quot; command from this debug menu. This will
resolve the issue. (878) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># On some MACs , some cursors and icons in MMKit and
dashboard are not displayed (1824, 1838)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Image with a bmp extension is not rendered in Povray
Scene feature (although a .bmp file is created in the PovRay Files directory of
that model. (2110)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>LINUX ONLY BUGS</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># System crashes while accessing wiki help via the URL
provided in What's this text of that mode. Workaround is to use the Mode
specific Wiki Help dialog that pops up when you hit F1 key (1447)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># NanoEngineer-1 sometimes crashes while operating on a
bigger file and extensively using features such as clipboard, copy, extrude,
select, undo etc. (1885)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Minimize progress messages in the status bar is
truncated for lower resolution and larger font size (1794)&nbsp; </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Status bar text on bottom right corner can get obscured
during minimize or simulation and thus affects the display of (for example) the
minimize progress.&nbsp; (1282)</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>#Opening a plot file from the plot tool dialogs needs 'kwrite'
editor which is available with only with KDE desktop (434) &nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># Modeling Kit in Build Mode: When you enter build mode,
this dialog first appears in the middle of the 3D workspace (graphics
area)&nbsp;for a fraction of second and then it is moved to the left hand side
of the NE1 main window. The amount of time this dialog stays inside the 3D
workspace depends on the model size. (844) </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText># When you start the program in a consol window, some
warning messages will be printed. E.g. Warning: import bsddb failed; using some
other db format for preferences file giving it a different name in case that
uses an incompatible binary format; this means, when you upgrade to bsddb,
you'll lose your preferences. This is a known issue and will be fixed in a
future release. (1896)</p>
