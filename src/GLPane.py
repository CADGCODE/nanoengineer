            or make a sibling method! [bruce 041223]
        
           Show a warning to the user, without interrupting them
           (i.e. not in a dialog) unless bother_user_with_dialog is
           true, or unless ensure_visible is true and there's no other
           way to be sure they'll see the message.  (If neither of
           these options is true, we might merely print the message to
           stdout.)

           In the future, this might go into a status bar in the
           window, if we can be sure it will remain visible long
           enough.  For now, that won't work, since some status bar
           messages I emit are vanishing almost instantly, and I can't
           yet predict which ones will do that.  Due to that problem
           and since the stdout/stderr output might be hidden from the
           user, ensure_visible implies bother_user_with_dialog for
           now.  (And when we change that, we have to figure out
           whether all the calls that no longer use dialogs are still
           ok.)

           In the future, all these messages will also probably get
           timestamped and recorded in a log file, in addition to
           whereever they're shown now.

           This is an experimental method, not yet uniformly used
           (most uses are in modes.py), and it's likely to be revised
           a few times in API as well as in implemention. [bruce

            # was ever called. Maybe that would fix other bugs... but not cmenu op bugs like 1411 (or new ones the above-mentioned
            # change also caused), since in those, the checkpoint_before_drag happens, but the cmenu swallows up the
            # releaseEvent so the checkpoint_after_drag never has a chance to run. Instead, I'm fixing those by wrapping
            # most_of_paintGL in its own begin/end checkpoints, and (unlike the obs after_op) putting them after
