getTarballs.py is a script which downloads the backup tarballs from
cvsdude.org. The idea is to run this script on a weekly basis, throw
the tarballs on a couple of CDROMs, and ship one to Michigan. The same
CDROMs might also include the release packages for the same week. If
we could get the wiki tarball on there too, we'd have everything.

When setting up a cron job (see "man 5 crontab"), be sure to put the
getTarballs.py script somewhere it's easy to find. Cron jobs run with
minimal environment variables, so spell out full pathnames. Here is an
example that would run at 4:30 AM every Sunday.
