Drs. Tour and Lamminen -

I am a software developer for a company called Nanorex, based in
Michigan. We are providing software for a chemistry/nanotechnology
curriculum this summer at the COSMOS class for high schoolers, at UC
Santa Cruz in California. Our software allows the kids to build
molecular models on the screen and perform some molecular dynamics on
them. We intend that our software will eventually grow into a
computer-aided design system useful to nanotecnology engineers.

Following the conventions of other CAD programs, we have a part
library with various chemical structures that can be imported to the
workspace. We have recently added the Rice University Nano-Kids to our
part library, as well as Dr. Tour's "nanocar".

I am working on getting together all the licenses and attributions for
the various pieces of other peoples' work that we will distribute with
our software. What kind of license or attribution would be appropriate
for the inclusion of your structures in our part library? If you have
a piece of text you can email, I will put it in our licenses
directory.

Thanks very much
Will Ware
Nanorex, Inc.

Dear Will,

I am forwarding your request to Dr. Dustin James, Dr. Tour's lab manager and
senior research scientist. He will know what is required.

Thank you,
