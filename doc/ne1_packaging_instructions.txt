NanoEngineer packaging instructions:

1. Windows: Atom python code packaging instructions: 
a) Copy cad/src code souce directory into a packaging directory(say, \packaging), make sure it works in this directory: python atom.py.
b) Put the setup.py into the same directory as above.
c) Under command prompt, run: python setup.py py2exe --includes sip --excludes OpenGL.
d) It will create a "build" and "dist" directory after step 3).
e) Copy the "OpenGL" directory from python home directory/Lib/site-packages to "dist" directory.
f) Change library.zip to library1.zip, create a directory called libary.zip, unzip all the files in library1.zip into directory library.zip.
g) Copy the "OpenGL" directory into library.zip directory too.
h) Delete unnecessary OpenGL extensions, py files , tcl, tk modules in "dist" and "dist/libary.zip" directory.
i) Copy ImageFile.pyc, JpegImagePlugin.pyc into "dist/libary.zip".
j) Copy glut32.dll, msvcr71.dll into "dist" .

2. Windows: Atom installation packaging instructions:
a) Create a directory to build installation packages(say, ...\distribution), all following steps is relative to this directory.
b) Create a directory called "program", copy all stuff from "dist" in Instruction 1 into "program".
c) Create a directory called "bin", copy assistant.exe, simulator.exe into this directory.
d) Copy "images" and "doc" from cad into this directory.
e) Modify "setup.iss" to customize the software installation, compile it to build "setup.exe" in a directory called "output".


3. Mac OS X: Atom python code packaging instructions:
   Mostly are similar as steps in instruction 1. 
For step (3), run: python setup.py py2app --includes sip --packages OpenGL
Skip steps (5), (6), (7), (9), (10).

4. Mac OS X: Atom installation packaging instructions:
Refer the instructions of packageMaker to build *.pkg file and optionally put the *.pkg into disk image file *.dmg.
