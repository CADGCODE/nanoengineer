<h1 align=center>About nanoENGINEER-1&trade; </h1>
<p>  nanoENGINEER-1 is a 3-D engineering program for designing and simulating  molecular machine systems.
<p>nanoENGINEER-1 includes a molecular design module that combines capabilities found in traditional chemistry modeling software with features found in popular 3-D mechanical CAD systems. With nanoENGINEER-1, users can design atomically precise assemblies from a variety of stiff covalent structures, including diamond-lattice frameworks. A parts library of molecular components is also included containing tubes, shafts, bearings, gears, joints, and springs that can be easily inserted and integrated with an existing assembly.
<p> In addition, nanoENGINEER-1 includes a molecular dynamics module (based on  MM2) with motors, grounds and dampers that can be attached to a model to create interactive movies of molecular simulations. These movies can be played in forward or reverse, allowing the user to inspect the simulation results graphically at any point of the animation, from any angle. This tight coupling between design and simulation allows for rapid prototyping, analysis, refinement and validation of theoretical nanosystem designs. </p>
<p> nanoENGINEER-1 is supported on the following platforms:
      
<ul>
  <li> <b>MS/Windows</b> -- Windows XP
  <li> <b>Linux</b> -- Mandrake 10.1 
  <li> <b>Macintosh</b> -- Mac OS X v10.3 (Panther)
</ul>
<p> nanoENGINEER-1 for Linux and Mac is Open Source software released under the GNU GPL. nanoENGINEER-1 for Windows cannot be released under the GNU GPL because the Windows libraries for Qt and PyQt are not based on Open Source. This is why nanoENGINEER-1 for Windows is not released under the GNU GPL.
