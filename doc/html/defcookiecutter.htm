      <p align="justify">The cookie cutter lets you make cutouts from diamond sheets with (1, 0, 0), (1, 1, 0), and (1, 1, 1) surfaces. You can select the surface from the dashboard, or by using the trackball <a href="mouseactions.htm#MMB">MMB</a> you can turn the lattice to the designated orientations of the lattice before you cut anything out. After you cut something out, the point of view for cutting is locked. The  <a href="mouseactions.htm#MMB">MMB</a> can still be used to see a side view of your current work.</p>
      <p align="justify">To cut out shapes, use the left mouse button. 


If the <a href="mouseactions.htm#LMB">LMB</a> is pressed and dragged there are two types of bounded selections. The first is a rectangular bounding box specified by starting and ending points at the corners of a rectangle. The second is a lasso or freehand curve. Both lasso and rectangle will be drawn initially; the program determines through the use of the mouse whether a rectangle or lasso will be used. If the user draws a circle with the mouse the Lasso will be used. If the user draws a straight line down and a straight line over the rectangle will be used. If the rectangle still appears on the screen it is active; once the rectangle vanishes the lasso will remain and be used.</p>
        <p align="justify">The third selection method uses a series of clicks to draw rubber-band lines that bounds an area of the surface. The bounding box is then closed by selecting a final point near the original one, or by double-clicking on the final (separate) point.</p>
        <p align="justify">Mouse selections add shape to the original selection. You can select an area of the lattice, when a second area is selected it will be added to the first area. Overlapping shapes are joined together. If you hold down the control key while drawing a shape, the newly drawn shape will be subtracted from the current layer.</p>
        <p align="justify">The thickness of your sheet can be specified two ways through the dashboard. The thickness of the surface can be typed in angstroms into the form box on the dashboard. The second way thickness can be specified is by using the spinbox to indicate multiples of a cell thickness. The cell thickness varies with orientation so that the structure of successive layers is the same.</p>
        <p align="justify">The ability to change the thickness of the drawn shapes on the lattice in Cookie Cutter mode makes it possible to create topographic shapes (see tutorial 2). Changing the thickness allows the user to add or subtract from a selected area giving the ability to hollow out a box. A cube can be cut into the lattice and then a second smaller cube can be subtracted from the original cube. This could be used to draw a (10x10) box on the screen, with 10 indicated in the thickness column. Before leaving the Cookie Cutter mode a second (8 x 8) box with thickness 8 can be subtracted from the original.</p>
        <p align="justify">A layer can be &quot;pushed down&quot; and another layer drawn on top of it. Push a layer down using the layers tool on the dashboard or the <a href="mouseactions.htm#RMB">RMB</a> context menu. The bottom of the new layer will be the top of the highest shape on the previous one.</p>
