        <p align="justify">Build mode has been designed for modifying structures on a detailed level. If the user enters via the build mode tool, the default is to add atoms of the specified element with a left click. If Build mode is entered from the Paste tool the default is to add chunks from the clipboard. You can switch back and forth by using the radio buttons on the dashboard. The combo boxes let you choose which of either kind of thing will be added. Elements can also be selected by using the Change Element tool. The Change Element tool opens a small version of the periodic table. The Change Element tool is one way to select the type of element to be added to a chunk in Build mode. Keyboard keys, such as &quot;c&quot; for carbon, &quot;h&quot; for hydrogen, can also activate different elements to be used in Build mode.</p>
        <p align="justify">The view in Build mode is as if looking down on the surface of a swimming pool. Atoms above the &quot;water's surface&quot; are live and can be added to, moved, or deleted. Atoms below the surface are disabled, so that you can concentrate on one part of a large structure.</p>
        <p align="justify">A bare left click over empty space will drop a copy of the item or the default atom (depending on how Build Mode was entered) where the cursor is on the &quot;water's surface&quot;. If there are <a href="singlet.htm">open bonds</a> above the surface, they will light up as the cursor passes over them. Clicking on a &ldquo;lit-up&rdquo; <a href="singlet.htm">open bond</a> will attach the type of atom designated by the combo box or the Element selector to the <a href="singlet.htm">open bond</a>. If there are other <a href="singlet.htm">open bonds</a> near the one you deposited on, the new atom will be bonded to them as well.&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify">Moving the cursor over atoms causes them to light up. Lit up atoms can be grabbed with the <a href="mouseactions.htm#LMB">LMB</a> and dragged. This drags the chunk the atom is connected to, the chunk can be moved or rotated. If the chunk is attached to another chunk by a single bond, the bond will be treated as a pivot point for the motion. If connected by two bonds, the chunk will pivot around the line between them, as a hinge.</p>
        <p align="justify">Atoms and open bonds can be moved individually by using shift and the <a href="mouseactions.htm#LMB">LMB</a> together.&nbsp;The lit-up atom will be dragged around, and its bonds will be stretched. The lit-up bond will be rotated around the atom in a way depending on the atom's connectivity. Holding the shift button and the <a href="mouseactions.htm#LMB">LMB</a> over a <a href="singlet.htm">open bond</a> creates a white line that can be stretched from one open bond to another. Dropping the line onto another bond once the second <a href="singlet.htm">open bond</a> lights up will cause the two <a href="singlet.htm">open bonds</a> to bond.</p>
        <p align="justify">Holding the control key and the <a href="mouseactions.htm#LMB">LMB</a> on a lit-up atom deletes the atom.</p>
        <p align="justify">In order to add Chunks to open bonds using the left mouse button a hotspot is needed, or a selected open bond. A hotspot or selected open bond is defined to be the one to be connected to when the chunk is added. A chunk with only one open bond will have that automatically set as its hotspot. In the case of several <a href="singlet.htm">open bonds</a> place the cursor to light up the desired bond of a chunk in build mode, press the <a href="mouseactions.htm#RMB">RMB</a>, and select &quot;set hotspot&quot; from the context menu. A copy of the chunk will be put in the clipboard with its hotspot set. A hotspot will bond to another chunk at the point that is set as the hotspot. The chunk will have a copy of itself attached to the next selected <a href="singlet.htm">open bond</a>.</p>
        <p align="justify">Bonds will appear in red to indicate a stretched and stressed bond. Selecting the minimize feature will mimize the length of the bond. This will assist in creating accurate structures. </p>
